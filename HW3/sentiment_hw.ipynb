I've had friends text me once I get in the club telling me they saw me walk in and I just go \\\"whoops! well.... I'll see you when you're done in that line! (;\\\".

            "Review: Birthday celebrations should be done up big and Beso definitely fits that description. From their signature cocktails to the food, very little disappoints. It was a friends birthday and she wanted to come to Beso then followed by a night of dancing up at Eve. This is definitely her right with the world ending and all.\\n\\nWe got their at 9pm and half of our group was running late, so we sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The Raspberry Beso is a definite must get for anyone who loves this berry, because it is has two types of raspberry liquors and fresh berries muddled in. The Cosmic Ginger was also a fine choice. I am a big fan of this root and it does not disappoint. The BBO was a blood orange centered drink, but was overpowered by the alcohol. My favorite was the Pear and Elderberry Sangria. It was a light white wine base with mellow flavors. All of these handcrafted drinks cost $15.\\n\\nWhen the rest of the party did show up, we ordered everything family style. Not too long after settling, orders of the paella balls, Eva's guacamole, seared crab cakes, olives and shaved almonds came out. As my friends would say, the guac was legit. The pure avocado goodness was balanced with no flavor being too strong. When breaking the crab cakes you could see the defined chunks of meat instead of a mass of unidentifiable mystery substance. The paella bites were my favorite. They were crisp on on the outside and soft in the center. This is an ingenious way to give the guest that crispy bottom of the pan feeling in every bite.\\n\\nFor entrees we got the chili rubbed skirt steak, salmon, pan seared chicken, and seared ahi tuna. The sides consisted of mac and cheese, house mash potatoes, and asparagus. The star of the dinner was the steak. Although it was the cheapest cut on the whole menu, it was tender and bursting with flavor. Even if price was not a factor, I would have ordered it again. The sides were all very good, but the mac and cheese was the best. It was creamy and decadent. I only allowed myself a few bites because it is a slippery slop to heaping scoops.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the churros, a banana creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. Fried dough and sugary is never a mistake right? Especially at Beso. They were light, soft and better than any churro I have ever had. They came with a caramel sauce and whipped cream for dipping. It is not a suggestion. The creme brulee was good, just not as noteworthy. The chocolate cake, on the other hand, struck a up a negative reaction. It was salty on it's own, but when paired with the ice cream it was a nice mix of sweet and salty like caramel, but you do not get too much of the frozen delight, so it went mainly uneaten.  \\n\\nThis is a great restaurant to impress a date. The atmosphere is romantic yet clubby for a modern and sheik clientele.\n",

Consider yourself warned.  If you want it spicy, then this is probably your place.  But what used to be \\\"taste with a bit of a bite\\\" is now \\\"spice with very little taste\\\".

I would have given a 5-star review based on the service we received AFTER the initial walk-in, but I can't forget that look of disapproval.  I wasn't dressed up, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't toting a fanny pack either.  My girlfriend was dressed up.\\n\\nWe picked out and purchased a pair of heels that they had in-stock.  We were on the fence about a pair of suede boots.  The salespeople seemed happy as we walked out the door and asked us to come back soon!

I called the store and told them that we wanted them.  They asked if we would be coming back to the store or if we would like them delivered to our room.  Delivery, of course.  I kid you not, they beat us to the room!  By the time we got paid out on our machine and walked up to our room, the boots were sitting there with a thank you card.  Talk about great service!\\n\\nIn the end, we had a nice experience with this store and the staff.  However, I realize that if I had not bought anything, I might not have felt the same way.

            "Review: I've been wanting to try this place for sometime and Restaurant Week was a perfect time to do it!\\n\\nMy friends and I made reservations for 7:30, when we arrived they greeted us and said they were just waiting for our table to be cleared and to hang out at the bar until it was ready. So we headed to the bar and were seated about 10 minutes later. \\n\\nThe first cool thing about this place is the caricatures on the wall, there  famous and some local faces with their names and even some signature everywhere you looked! I thought this was a very cool touch!\\n\\nOnce seated we were presented with one of the most amazing bread baskets I've seen. But keep in mind, I'm totally a bread lover! There was a white, wheat and whole grain, sweet cinnamon and even breadsticks! It's a bread lovers dream. \\n\\nThe menu looked absolutely delicious, I ordered the lobster bisque, jumbo lump crab cakes and mango salsa and key lime pie for dessert.\\n\\nThe lobster bisque was divine! It was creamy and rich. The only thing I wanted was more lobster! Other than that it was one of the best I've tasted! But make sure they add some cracked pepper for more flavor! \\n\\nThe jumbo lump crab cakes were absolutely amazing.  Literally overwhelmed with crab meat...OH MY GOODNESS. I really don't have another way to describe it, they were outstanding! The mango salsa was really fresh and worked as a great compliment with the meal.\\n\\nThey key lime pie was great too! A great and refreshing way to end the meal. \\n\\nThis place was really great! Our server was wonderful and we had a lovely time. Look forward to returning!\n",

            "Review: This place is now called Medley Buffet. Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their \\\"Hawaiian\\\" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc. \\n\\nBut the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon \\\"the best pork\\\" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.\\n\\nSo we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.\\n\\nThey have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.\\n\\nSo yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all.\n",

            "Review: OK so i usually get my car washed for free at the dealer but was short on time and decided to give this place a whirl. The entrance is a bit strange and when you first arrive its not very clear where you need to go to get the ticket written up,anyways found that. I decided on the 19.99 deal and with my 3 dollar yelp discount paid 16.99. first thing you notice is this place appears to have a lot of employees running around,what they are all doing is a mystery to me since the reason I came in was to get my car washed and that was done poorly ,I can only assume they are all running around stocking shelves,I mean this place is almost like a mini market,they are selling way more then just car washes here,which is really detracting from the quality of the wash itself. Part of my 19.99 (16.99) wash was scented air,to my surprise when i went in they handed me a scented tree to hang on my rear view mirror,WTF? this isn't 1982 and I don't drive an old beater,all the car washes i have ever been to that offer this is a package item actually spray the scent in the car,not  give you some cheesy tree to hang in the car,i tossed that shit away. when my car came out it sat out in the hot sun for at least 7-8 minutes,not under the shade which all the other cars were under,i was going to say something and then i noticed the person who was going to do my car,I told him as i usually do to the people who work on my car,I want special attention given to the wheels and tire dressing and pointed out a few trouble areas that I wanted him to address,he said no problem,I gave him the 5 bucks and when i started to drive out they had bent my side view mirrors in and when i popped them back out they were filthy,the windows were filthy the car was horrible,i was in a rush so I didnt have time to have him do it all again,I just will not return. i get better washes when they are free at the dealer. This place needs to focus on what kind of business they want to be and hire people who will reflect that vision,not slackers with no sense or sight. I would never reccomend this place to anyone unless they like to pay to have a half ass job done.\n",

            "Review: As cool as this roller coaster looks and as neat as the concept is of winding your way around the New York cityscape, as other reviewers have said this coaster is probably best enjoyed by observing it rather than experiencing it. I have been on dozens of roller coasters at theme parks all over the country, and I've never been on a steel roller coaster that was this jerky and bumpy. In fact, i've been on wooden roller coasters that were much smoother than this one. After I was done riding it, I felt like my brain had been thrown around and I was sore in multiple parts of my body. Not in a good way, either. It just seems like it was very poorly designed and the bumpyness of it takes away from the whole experience. \\n\\nThe fact that it's so much money just for one ride also makes this not a very wise decision either. For $14 you can almost take your whole family for $3.99 steak and eggs at Tuscany. Probably the only good thing I can say about it is that the line wasn't very long, I only had to wait maybe 10 minutes to get on the ride. \\n\\nI love roller coasters, but this is one that I'm sure I won't be returning to anytime soon.\n",

Having been in food service at one time I hate to go in right at closing so I decided to go elsewhere, though they assured me it was no problem. The time is 3:20. \\n\\nIn the same strip mall I spot Hamburger Haven. Their sign says OPEN, they have no hours posted, but there are people inside. I decide to try it out. I walk in to order and wait while another group gets its food then commences to ask for a bunch of little items that keep the guy busy running back and forth. He finally got around to asking me what I wanted. Not friendly, maybe a little annoyed. I order the food. I can see the guy cooking grumble in the back. I'm thinking to myself, \\\"what's so hard about a cheeseburger and onion rings?\\\" I am not feeling welcome. \\n\\nThe food came out. Not bad at all. Nothing great, fried stuff, but decent all the same. I'm sitting there eating, trying to tell myself the bad vibes are my imagination when a third guy appears behind the counter. He looks out at the people in the restaurant, frowns a little, then marches to the front door to flip off the OPEN sign. Ah, they were closed I guess. I suppose that is why the employees seemed annoyed. \\n\\nI have an idea for this place. If you want to close at a certain time post a sign with your hours. Also, remember to turn off the OPEN sign. Finally, if you don't want to serve someone just let them know. It will probably annoy them, but they might try you again in the future. With thousands of restaurants in the city life is too short to put up with an attitude of any kind.\n",

            "Review: I was a loyal customer of this Discount Tire up until this week. They replaced a wheel for me in 2013 following a car accident. They offered me a hubcap, but I wanted it to match the others, so I was very explicit with them that I would be purchasing a factory hubcap. When I purchased the first hubcap off ebay, it didn't fit properly on the wheel, and I assumed I had purchased the wrong hubcap by mistake.\\n\\nIn May, when GM recalled my car, I ordered a factory hubcap through my dealer to make sure it was right this time. When that one didn't fit, I realized the wheel was the problem. When I called Discount Tire, they said of course it doesn't fit, you have one of our stock wheels on. Had it been explained to me that the wheel wouldn't fit the hubcap I was VERY clear that I wanted, I never would have purchased it!\\n\\nThey assured me this would be fixed, and that they would not only order me the correct wheel, but would take off the cost of the wheel I had already purchased. I gave them a month, and called back to inquire as to the status of my order. They explained that they  had placed the order, but since they ordered it from the factory, they were waiting on GM to ship it. I got the same story again in July, and August. When I called again this month, I was told that they didn't have an order for me out at all, there was no note on my account about any of this, and they had no idea what I was talking about. I either fell through the cracks, or someone decided I simply wasn't worth the trouble or the money I had spent there.\\n\\nI am livid, and will never give this location another dime. I contacted another discount tire, and they got me a new wheel by the next business day, no hassle!\n",

            "Review: What can I say about this show? Lots of mixed feelings.\\n\\nFirst of all, I don't care how famous you are. When it says the show starts at 11, doors open at 10:30, at least try to stay close to the schedule. I can be forgiving if its 10, maybe 15 minutes late, BUT DAMN! You start the show at 11:45? To add to that, there was no explanation whatsoever as to the late start. Now if this was on a friday night, then maybe it just might be okay. But since it was on a thursday, I have to get up for work at 6 am. So by the time I got to bed, it was 2 am. \\n\\nSo we sit down at 11:15 thinking it should start soon, maybe 10 minutes. For the next half hour, we hear about 3 announcements stating for us to go get some Tyku alcohol. By the time the show started, some people have left already and some were sound asleep. One thing is for sure, whoever was left was definitely tired.\\n\\nFinally it starts and there is a wild round of applause, probably because it was about damn time! Here is a quick description of the show. CeeLo sings covers of other songs including his own hits while the large screen behind him shows off a lot of graphics, while his sexy backup dancers are dancing along side of him. From time to time he has other performers sing which is a good thing because being the large man that he is, he needs the rest. \\n\\nThe two stars are for when things did go right, it was actually very entertaining.\\n\\nNow for the things that went wrong. The number one thing that bothered me and im sure a lot of people were thinking the same thing was that all the singing performers were singing to recorded music and you can tell that they were lip syncing a couple times. The sound quality was off several times meaning the music was louder than the singer and vice versa. Lastly, the flow of the show was very erratic. There was a period when CeeLo finished a song, walked off the stage, and all the lights went out. I would say for about 5 minutes we sat there and wondered if the show was done or if was a real intermission. Then all of a sudden the next song starts. Huh? No flow whatsoever.\\n\\nI got free tickets to this show but if I paid for it, I would be really disappointed. CeeLo, if you are reading this, im sure you are yelling at your producer or whoever is responsible for how this show is run. Im sure it's not your fault. You are good at what you do and there's no denying that. In my opinion, more work needs to be done. Usually the best singing shows have a live band. That right there would be a start. Maybe the next time I see your show again, you will have all the kinks worked out. Only then, maybe I can bump you up to 4 or 5 stars.\n",

Unfortunately the excitement quickly wore off when I ate there.\\n\\n**THIS IS NOT A HIBACHI PLACE** Hibachi is with an OPEN GRATE GRILL - you can tell who the N00b reviewers are here to this style of cuisine-They dont know what they are talking about.\\n\\nI have ate at various Teppan steakhouses in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Hawaii, and Las Vegas so I have extensive experience in knowing what is good and bad teppan style dining.   \\n\\nIf you have never ate at a teppan steakhouse than I am sure you will find this review useless and your experience there great because its your first time.  Teppan steakhouses is the style of Japanese dining where they cook right in front of you. Benihana is one of the more popular chain restaurants that has this style of cooking.  \\n\\nThe chefs are all under experienced (except the master chef who i have yet to see at a cooking table) and the rice, vegetables steak and chicken are all under par in comparison to other restaurants I have been too.  Also, hayashi doesnt have a lunch menu on the weekends, they charge FULL DINNER PRICE. ... Ah-So doesnt do that, you can get the same dinner meal at lunch on the weekend at Ah So for less.\\n\\nAlso, I have a Japanese friend that ate at the non-teppan side and the waitress was Japanese and she found it difficult to recommend a good authentic Japanese dish.  \\n\\nTake a look at all the good reviews here... not a single Japanese person will recommend this place.  Its GRINGO Japanese,... like Taco Bell is Mexican to people. \\n\\nIf you are looking for good caliber teppan style cooking this isnt the place... I am sure others will disagree but I also here people recommending great mexican food and when I check it out its totally horrible food... i guess taco bell and del taco are too much of an influence on people in regards to what is real mexican cuisine, but that is another review.\\n\\nUPDATE: Went there to lunch for just SUSHI and waited and waited and waited... we bailed on them.  Horrible place to eat ... I hope they close and another better Japanese restaurant opens in its place.\n",

I don't Yelp as much as I should... but when I left my dinner here, I knew I had to Yelp this!\\n\\nWe were at BlogWord Expo and had dinner planned with friends and colleagues with a group of 15. We asked if seperate checks were doable (as anyone would with a large group) and she said yes. \\n\\nWe sat down at the table and within minutes the waitress dropped glasses (not one but a few) of water over a friend and the glass shattered all over the floor. My friend was wet. Accidents happen... we get that. But how this was handled was bad. A simple sorry, to be followed by waiting in wet broken glass for 15 minutes until they took care of the situation. \\n\\nWe brushed that off and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later we received our drinks and no interest in taking our food order. We had to ask the manager to have our order taken. 10 more minutes later, they began to take our order. Each time we wanted another drink, we had to flag down the waitress. She never proactively checked in on us at all. We waited... waited... for another 45 minutes until food arrived. \\n\\nThe food was ok. The margaritas were great! So great we asked for a larger glass for each serving. Each serving was in a 16 ounce-ish glass and the larger glass was more like 21 ounce. Not a double portion right? Remember this...\\n\\nWe decided after 3 hours of this service, we decided its time to go. Asked for the check and they brought it out on one. We asked them prior if separate checks were ok. We asked for the manager... apparently their cash registers can not handle separate checks past 12 people. This took rocket science apparently so the waitress gathered several people and begun doing backroom calculus to divide the check. It had to be that complex, because we waited for another HOUR for the check. That had to have been hard math!\\n\\nThe bills came finally... and those $12 margaritas asked to be in just a little larger glass came out to be $24 each! She didn't tell us she would charge double and not double the size for these drinks!\\n\\nThe worst experience I have ever had! $150 for two people and this bad of service!

            "Review: It feels senseless attempting to use written words to portray the three-day nirvana that was EDC 2012...but here goes nothing!\\n\\nEDC 2012 was my third EDC.This year, I arrived in Las Vegas with two goals: the first, to not end up separated from my crew (which I somehow managed to do not once, not twice, but on all three days of EDC 2011)...and the second, to dive in to EDC headfirst and finish the weekend with no regrets... \\n\\nBoth of these goals were accomplished by leaps and bounds, despite the fact that EDC required my friends and I to bust more missions than I ever considered myself capable of (thanks in no small part to a wallet/EDC ticket/ID/credit card that was stolen on the dancefloor, our befriending of a lovely Canadian girl who had arrived in Las Vegas with nowhere to stay for the weekend, one friend's parents threatening the disownment of their daughter, and a host of other situations that brought my friends and I closer together than ever before). For the weekend to have turned out to be such a RESOUNDING success despite the onset of one shitshow setback after another shows how truly special and amazing of an event EDC is. Anyways, here are my highlights:\\n\\n- Dusk 'til dawn! EDC's most unique characteristic is the festival's \\\"sunset to sunrise\\\" format, which demands as much as your body and your willpower are willing to put out - you'll find yourself with a reversed body clock by the end of the third day. Go for the three-day stretch - you'll find yourself with a newfound appreciation for yourself and the limits of your body.\\n\\n- The talent! Insomniac spared no expense in assembling a world-class lineup of DJs for EDC 2012. In a span of three days, I was able to see Steve Angello, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Knife Party, and a whole host of the best that electronic/dance music has to offer. Every DJ who played at EDC brought their A-game, throwing down banger after banger and keepin' the party rockin'. I will never forget screaming \\\"This IS Paradise\\\" at the top of my lungs while seeing Fedde Le Grand bring in sunrise with his tune of the same name...nor will I forget hitching a ride atop a VIP cart in the heart of the crowd during David Guetta's \\\"Without You\\\", waving out to a sea of people, all of whom were cheering right back at my friends and I.\\n\\n- The production value, stage designs and lighting effects that were nothing short of world class...\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6NG_A-epYEpsJSugfAaTRQ?select=oKal-wTRBxCJjWzIhcaXig#6sN5BGLpzMnJjYIcjSyt_w\\n\\nEDC fully displays Insomniac's credo - \\\"it's all about the experience.\\\" The Kinetic Field - although not as jaw-dropping as last year's office building-sized structure, was \\\"hollow\\\", in that festival goers were now able to view sunrise through the stage itself. Equally breathtaking were the visual displays accompanying each DJ set; oozing neon colors and trippy illustrations came straight out of (the best kind of) an acid trip. I witnessed dozens of acrobats, costumed performers, fire dancers , and the ever-popular Mirror Man grace EDC with their talents; no details were overlooked in terms of the event's aesthetics. For example, the Red Bull Skydivers glided down to earth, shooting sparks each night...legit.\\n\\nOH, and I haven't even gotten to the fireworks yet. It looks like EDC has prematurely spoiled my 4th of July...\\n\\n- The sense of togetherness found within the crowds at EDC is unlike that of any other event. Because EDC calls for a serious investment of time, money, and energy, there's a filter effect that takes place. Obnoxious assholes and creepy hoodie-wearing tweakers are very much the minority at EDCLV (unlike most massive events held within the SoCal area), and I can speak from experience in saying that the overwhelming majority of the people that I met at EDC were fun-loving partygoers who were very polite (making way for your chain of head-bobbing friends as you navigate a crowd), down-to-earth, and friendly. \\n\\nThis same sense of good-natured behavior was emphasized by the Speedway staff and the Las Vegas Metro PD; when my friend lost his wallet, the police officers whom we asked for help were very much courteous (albeit powerless, as no definite lost & found had been set up...lovely). Did I mention that we hitchhiked our way back to the strip with some awesome Good Samiritan ravers on the first night (due to aforementioned stolen wallet)? EDC gives me faith in the good nature of human beings.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but really you'd have to experience EDC for yourself to fully know just how inspiring and life-changing of an event this is. I didn't really touch on the cons of EDC 2012 (god-awful traffic to/from the Speedway, inept organization with regards to the lost & found, a lack of food options to choose from, Mother Nature giving Saturday night the middle finger), but frankly, that's because all negativity had been erased from my mind for the weekend. For three days, EDC enabled my friends and I to touch the sky!\n",

            "Review: Truly a fantastic meal. I would have been happy to pay 3 or 4 times the price for what I got. I have zero complaints and I've been raving about this place nonstop since my first visit. I am going to become a regular and bring a lot of friends here.\\n\\nMy date and I each got meatballs - classic with classic sauce, and vegetarian with parmesan cream sauce, split truffled white beans and pancetta as a side, and had a Shock Top draft and a watermelon mojito to drink. All totaled, $31.71 with tax!\\n\\nBoth main courses were divine. The sauces were tastefully portioned as an accompaniment to the meatballs, rather than drowning them. With the classic-classic combination, I got exactly what I wanted: the taste of my Italian grandmother's cooking that I loved so fondly as a child. Tender meatballs and silky, fresh tomato sauce impressed me so much that I made a point of personally complimenting one of the owners, who was present. Our vegetarian meatballs were right up my alley: not an attempt to be a meat substitute, but rather a playful representation of the beauty of simple vegetables in the ironic form of processed meat. Lentils dominated their flavor, and as a huge fan of lentils, I enjoyed them ecstatically.\\n\\nThe truffled white beans and pancetta side was crafted beautifully. Simple, rustic, and bursting with hearty flavor; a mild accent of truffles; giddy reactions from both me and my date. With just one side dish and some simple sourdough bread, the meal rounded out to be surprisingly filling and satisfying. I normally overeat, and shamefully so - but at this restaurant I paid very little for the quality of food I enjoyed, and left with a thoroughly bedded appetite.\\n\\nThe service was just about immaculate: simple, courteous, straightforward, and attentive in the right ways. Staff seemed to be enthusiastic about the restaurant and excited to be a part of it, and were gushingly grateful for my compliments. I enjoyed the music and decor, and was impressed by the stocking of the bar given that this restaurant is located inside an outdoor shopping mall.\n",

The music does have a surprising range to it, but it all worked for us and it actually added another side to the dining experience that you don't usually find. It FELT like a night out at a lounge and that's what we were going for. The service was top notch: our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food came on time but not too fast. Gave us just enough time in between to enjoy our drinks (I recommend the Caiprihina... I had three and they are super tasty, especially in the hot weather). The manager or owner even came by at one point to ask how everything was. \\n\\nThe food was delicious, and just like others have said, there are so many things to choose from! We had three dishes from the tapas menu and combined they were plenty of food for us both. We had the duck empenadas, some kind of flat gorditas, and one of the pork belly selections. My favorite was the pork, and although the duck was good, the dough on the outside was a bit too thick and overwhelmed the filling a bit. The flavors were wonderful though, and we left very satisfied and not one regret about the price. Stop by for a fun night out!\n",

We took a quick glance at their menu and I told the waitress to serve me the spiciest sushi roll that they have. My mom ordered a simple Teriyaki Chicken off their Lunch Special Menu.\\n\\n15 minutes later, my order came. My sushi was not really that spicy. But it's ok. I liked the fact that the slices were kind of thin, so I don't look like a starved panda when I eat it. LOL Not sure if that was a coincidence, or they really serve them like that.\\n\\nI finished my meal but my mom's order hasn't even came yet. She was really getting pissed at this point. Since it's a late lunch, and the fact that we ordered pretty quick, having to wait 30 minutes for food is really inconvenient, to say the least.\\n\\nShe decided to cancel her order and we left with no TIP. I feel bad but I can't really justify the service out here. Since it's 2pm, there were only 3 tables occupied in there, including us, and the other tables had 2-4 people in it. \\n\\nI'm not coming back here and I wouldn't even recommend anyone to this place.\\nIt's just that bad :(\n",

First glance at the outdoor menu they offer daily lunch specials ranging from salads to Spanish influenced sandwiches.  Cheaply priced but not what guided me there, I wanted tapas damnit! The dining area is clean & pristine with a bright color scheme.  I sat at the bar and service was attentive.  Tried 3 items : \\n*Pan manchego - toasted bread, tomato sauce, aged manchego \\nTerrific flavor.  Simple but encompasses the flavors, temperatures & textures I was looking for\\n\\n*Spanish chicken croquetas ( aka tentadora )\\nChicken & bechamel \\nI hoped and prayed this would be the star of show.  I pretended to continue reading my paper but I obsessed about these little nuggets of heaven once I saw them on the menu.  Damn it if it wasn't just my luck.... Disappointment! The crunch and outer texture was heavenly. The bechamel and chicken filling though left me wondering what I had done in a past life to deserve such a tease.   From now on I will refer to these croquetas as the temptress or since it's a Spanish restaurant -  Tentadora\\n\\nSerrano Rice\\nChorizo, chicken, rabbit, Frito, saffron\\nFinal dish ordered and it ended on a high note.  All proteins were full of flavor and the sofrito was bold but not overwhelming.  \\n\\nMid-meal I decided to order a glass of red sangria ( maybe to drown my sorrows from the above listed temptress ).  One of the best red sangria I've had in some time.  If it wasn't the middle of the day and lunch time i could have easily enjoyed two-rty or so.  Not too sweet, great fresh fruit flavor and a nice kick of brandy at the end.  I surprised myself by not finishing it but it was the middle of the day and my work at Julian Serrano was complete.  Very good dining experience for $45 and I would come back for future visits.  Hopefully by that time I will have forgiven that EVIL tentadora.......\n",

I recently moved and was looking for a new studio so signed up for their two week trial. Come to my second class and ask for a yoga/mat rental and they lady says sorry we don't have any more but I could buy one for more than 60 dollars!!!!! Any other studio would have opened one of their mats and added it to their rental collection or would have not even made the mistake in the first place of not providing sufficient rental equipment. At the very least she could have extended my trial membership by one day since I didn't get to attend class today. It was extremely annoying. When you're paying ridiculous amounts for classes they should accommodate you better. If this yoga studio is just in a convenient location for you and you have money to blow then it's ok, but if you're lookig for true value and great teachers and atmosphere then check out some of the other studios in the area. Lucky for you Scottsdale has a ton and this yoga studio doesn't offer anything you cant get somewhere else.\\n\\nAlso, most of their good reviews are from when they were a part of Sumits Yoga. I've been to a couple sumit yoga studios and loved it every time. They've parted ways with sumit as they don't carry the studio name anymore (made clear by the outline of letters torn off their store front) so don't be deceived by these reviews that stem from when they had a previous owner as this is not the same place anymore and clearly the new management is struggling to follow in sumit's footsteps.\n",

I called them because I got a flyer on my door and they had a great special, 14 inch cheese pie for $5.00.  When I found the place it was small, clean and the person at the register was nice.  He told me all about their other offering, wings, sandwiches, deserts.  I love supporting small, family owned pizza joints. \\nWhen I got my pie I was excited to get it home and try it. \\n\\nOne thing I do not like about pizza is when the crust is soft and chewy.   I like a crisp crust.  So a few weeks later I thought, \\\"Well maybe I just should have specified\\\" that I like it \\\"Well Done\\\"  so I thought I would try it again.  my order came to $12.50 for a pizza AND 10 wings.  What a deal!  Only this time the crust was even more chewy and soft then before.  Very disappointed.  They are very nice people. \\nPerhaps I will try a sub sandwich from there sometime. \\n\\nBut I am done with their pizza.\n",

The salad and the dressing that it comes with compliments each other very well! I do not remember how many refills of salad we had gotten that day.\\n\\nThe eggplant itself was amazingly good! There was also sufficient amount of eggplant that was given. Defiantly quality italian food. \\n\\nOur server was also really great! She could not have been any nicer. She also gave us a slice of espresso cake which was probably one of the best cakes I've had in a while. I could be exaggerating but it really did taste good. \\n\\nCheck it out for yourself.

They are normally on time but will cry like babies if the stuff is heavy or if there are stairs.  Their pickup people are normally pretty friendly but a few are sketchy.\\n\\nPart of me wishes that I wasn't so lazy and could sell some of the items on my own because what I donate is worth WAY more than I am allowed to write off of my taxes.

My puppy is half Maltese and shihtzu so her breeds coat is that of a shihtzu. We told the groomer that we wanted a \\\"teddybear cut\\\" and even pointed to the picture of a Maltese with the exact cut on the wall.

That is not a teddybear cut! Any groomer should know that a teddybear cut requires you leave the length of the muzzle around and round out the face around the jaw line. She then left all her hair around the body long and cut her legs very thin at the bottom. My poor puppy looked absolutely awful. The groomers reasoning was that my puppies hair needed to grow out evenly so  \\\"she\\\" decided to shave her muzzle down. Of course my puppy had plenty of hair around her face and muzzle to be able to wear a \\\"teddybear cut\\\" .. I was livid. I ended up buying my own pet clipper set and shaved her down more evenly, however her face now looks like a poodle, and now it will take months to grow back! She also had knicks from the clipper on her stomach, and long patches of hair randomly around her mouth. Absolutely ridiculous ! I will never have my dog groomed there again!!!\n",

Before you get too excited, I gotta say the rushi rolls on the 50% off menu are about $3-5 over priced compare to other places.

            "Review: The Food. The View. The Service. The room. \\nThose are the things that all these reviews seem to cover so I will too.\\n\\nThe food: good, not mind-boggling, and certainly not proof of the existence of God. \\nI had the rustic pasta which was salty, but satisfying. Then the veal ribeye which was like fatty pork. The bread was nice but not great. The wines by the glass were pretty good but a severely limited selection.\\n\\nThe service: very good. Perhaps this is the best thing about the restaurant. Very attentive and gentle. The waiter, busboys, sommelier and manager were all invested in making the experience a good one. As Lawrence Welk said: Thank you boys.\\n\\nThe room: cold and charmless...like eating in the terminal at La Guardia...except for the hanging glass bubbles which made me feel like I was in a glass of club soda.\\n\\nThe view: very nice, but because the restaurant is kind of on the side, the view from the MIx bar is better. As well, the tables are too close together so that it feels like everyone around you can listen to your conversation. No intimacy at Mix.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with Mix is that the food is way too expensive. \\nI have one piece of advice, from someone who virtually eats out every night of the week...you will go out of business if you don't modify your price structure.\\nRead the business section of any newspaper: prices that were accceptable in 2004 are irresponsible and verging on offensive in 2009.\n",

Serious foodies are more about eating than boring everyone with over typing.  \\n\\nThis place is new and my waitress said they are working out quirks.  Everyone was very friendly.  \\n\\nVery comfortable setting.  What I love is that the food is cooked tasting Healthier.  Not greasy like some of those other buffets.  I loaded up 3 plate fulls.  Even though there was lots of sea food, I ate lots of perfectly cooked crisp green beans.  I am very picky about how thejy are cooked.  These guys did right.  The difference between this buffet and all the other guys,  Jasmine Tokyo's food is fresh, and a higher quality of  food.  I'm ruined for those other buffets now.  So if you complain about paying $19.99 for dinner with all that Quality food, then stay home.\n",

Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course. \\nThe Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it. \\nThe food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink. \\nFinally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant! \\n\\nThe food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was \\\"closing\\\". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done. \\n10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the \\\"courtesy\\\" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust! \\n\\nThe food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!\n",

While the restaurant is billed as \\\"authentically Italian\\\", in my opinion, it's far more Italian-American than traditional Italian fare (fine, if that's your thing).  Reminds me of the \\\"red sauce\\\" Italian places you find commonly in NYC.\\n\\nFirst up was a mozzarella di buffala with tomatoes and basil - a simple, classic dish that I love to make at home.  The dish was edible but the cheese was too firm, the olive oil was thin and watery and finally the basil was chopped too finely to be tasted.\\n\\nTwo pizzas were up for dinner, the Toscana with prosciutto, arugula and diced tomatoes and the \\\"chef's special\\\" with Italian sausage, rapini and parmigiano.  The first was fresh and tasty but a little uneventful.  The second was loaded with a cheap, salty parmigiano cheese that overwhelmed the flavours of the other ingredients.\\n\\nThe bring-your-own-wine, cash-only bit is a bit downscale given the prices. The servers are all in a tremendous rush to keep the food coming which makes it a difficult place to relax.  Great place to bring the kids since it's noisy and bustling though.  Given the chance, I probably wouldn't go back.\n",

I'll call them guy 1 and guy 2. Guy 1 was taking our order. When we ordered I asked if they had some sort of juice for our toddler. I saw guy 2 whisper something to guy 1. I didn't think anything of it. Guy 1 said they have milk, and because my toddler somehow hates milk this week I said it's ok, no drink for her. Then they told us they can get apple juice. So we ordered apple juice. It seemed like they had to get the apple juice from somewhere because it was delivered to our table. I'm very pleased, they didn't have to do this, but I can see that they try their best to satisfy the customers. I don't think the $1 I paid for the apple juice is worth them getting it from somewhere, but it goes without saying that we really appreciated it.\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, I really like the thin crusted pizza, almost like a flatbread, so I don't feel like I'm 10 pounds heavier by the time I'm done. We also ordered a small bowl of pasta with meatballs, it could've used a bit more flavor and seasoning. But overall, very pleased with this experience (third time at this location).\n",

            "Review: Wow. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I dined at Le Mitoyen last night, and it was some of the best food we've ever had. Executive chef Richard Bastien is a genius! The flavour combinations were out of this world, and the depth was incredible. \\n\\nLe Mitoyen is a converted house, built in 1870. There are several separate dining areas, a nice fireplace, artwork on the walls, candles at each table and soft music in the background. Service was excellent - each course was presented with a description of the ingredients.\\n\\nFor Valentine's day weekend, a prix fixe 7 course menu was offered ($85/each or $140/each with wine pairings) with a choice of one of 4 mains.\\n\\nWe started with a glass of champagne and the salmon cooked \\\"sous vide\\\" - basically vacuum sealed and cooked in an immersion circulator, I believe.  Is was served on a rectangle of watermelon with citrus. The marinade was vodka-based.  SO GOOD! The texture of the salmon was amazing, and nicely complimented the crispness of the watermelon. \\n\\nWe then had a lobster tail with a mango sauce, microgreens, and tiny cucumber balls. There was a taste we couldn't quite place, and then realized it was vanilla (we think!). Whoa. Vanilla lobster? Who would have thought... ? Delicious! \\n\\nNext was a white polenta atop moist guinea foul with a rich guinea foul gravy. It was garnished with fried grains, rice and quinoa that turned into a 'rice krispy' texture. Again, awesome. \\n\\nWe had the foie gras, served with a winter-root puree, carrots and a roast potato and spicy microgreens. I'm not a foie gras fan, but my boyfriend love it. The puree was delicious!  (not included in the prix fixe menu - an extra $17). \\n\\nAfter that, we had a delicious bouillon,  with finely diced carrots, and something with a bit of kick (couldn't quite place it...).  It is served spoon-less, and meant to be sipped.  \\n\\nFor the main course, I had the pigeonneau (yup!! domestic pigeon! I'm living on the wild side :P)  with wild mushroom risotto, and what I believe was a kind of liver mousse.  The sauce was flavourful,rich, and delicious, and the risotto was earthy and creamy. The pigeonneau was delicious and tender.  My boyfriend had the lamb, and it was amazing! So tender, and moist. \\n\\nWe finished with coffee and desserts.   We had an amazing profiterole filled with ricotta and tonka beans, and served with lemon curd. We also had a strawberry soup, with basil ice cream. Oh. My. Yum.  Honestly. Holy Food!!!! \\n\\nAt the end of our meal we noticed we had missed a course - a cheese based dish.  Our waitress was apologetic, and since we didn't want it after our dessert, we were credited the cost of a glass of champagne.  We were a pretty disappointed to have missed it, since it likely would have been amazing, like everything else.  A bit of a miss given the calibre of the restaurant. But, c'est la vie. \\n\\nThe service efficient and friendly,  allowing enough distance for a romantic evening but always close enough should anything be needed.\\n\\nHighly recommend! It's definitely pricey, but you're looking for a splurge, this is the spot.\n",

Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\\n\\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \\n\\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.\n",

It's been a month since my return of a mattress that was never even delivered to my home, and they have had unknown problem after problem processing my return which has stalled the return of my money.\\n\\nFirst the Ahwatukee Store Manager stopped taking my calls, Mike was great when I was purcahsing but had Clare speak to me whenever I followed up on my return,  claiming that corporate was processing it. Then when I called the customer service line, the guy brought me to tears. Between having no information on a month old return, claiming that a Tempur-Pedic base has no warranty, and refusing to let me speak to a manager, I felt completely de-humanized and powerless. As if I would never again see my [significant amount] of money.\\n\\nAfter harnessing my Google-fuu, I found corporate accounts payable who admitted my return had never even been addressed (over a month later), let alone processed, and she would bring it to a manager and I'd receive a call in 24hrs. No call. I just spoke with them, only to find out still nothing has been done. \\n\\nThe only things I can do is call, and start speaking up about this unprofessional treatment.. I feel completely powerless while they sit on my money, the Store Manager has his commission, and I have nothing. But if this continues I will have to look into further, and more serious, appropriate legal action. \\n\\nHow do you file a collections claim on a corporation?\n",

Upon our arrival, my boyfriend received his beverage right away but then waited another 10 min for a bartender to inquire about what I would like to drink. Another 4 min passed before we had to ask for menus and then another 15 min to take our order. There were maybe 10 people sitting at the bar with 2 bar tenders so they were not busy. When Adriana, our server/bartender, took out order she not only didn't know the menu bit gave us a bit of an attitude about the menu and told me I was wrong when I inquired about cheese on the Haus burger. Upon bringing us the INCORRECT order, she apologized and took the wrong order back to the kitchen. My boyfriend was waiting for me to get my food but it was taking a while so I told him to eat as his was getting cold.  The food was not very good and small portions for the cost. Not to mention, he asked for 2 or 3 beers that were on the menu but either changed or no longer offered but no one told us.

The bathrooms are a little outdated with weird wall paper and little pyramid shapes to them. The rooms are pretty quiet, you can't hear your neighbor. The pool looked cloudy and there were too many people in the pool for my comfort level so I did not even bother. The view from the 9th floor to the atrium was amazing and the view from our pyramid room was pretty nice facing Mandalay bay and the airport. \\nThe reason why the elevator shakes a lot is because the elevator is traveling across the pyramid. Its not like a typical elevator that goes up and down, its traveling diagonally. \\nThe luxor should take better care of the outside of the pyramid by cleaning the windows because it looks a little dusty. The hotel has a great design to it and its a shame to see it look shabby. The beam on top of the pyramid is pretty impressive. I suggest they should put light beams out of sphinx eyes that would be cool to see. Overall its a good place to stay on a budget in vegas. \\nMy final opinion of vegas overall I discovered that most of the vegas hotels smell like sewer not just the Luxor.\n",

My appointment was for a cut and color with Markis who is from New York and has been doing hair for more than 20 years.  Markis made me feel very comfortable, he consulted with me thoroughly to find out what I wanted my end-result to be.  I wanted him to get rid of the brassiness in my blonde and give me a more youthful cut.  Markis explained that he has had extensive experience with blondes and I could tell he was eager to get started.  During the color process I felt very comfortable in Markis' confidence and could tell he was very experienced.  Once my color and toner was done processing he started my cut and again, his confidence made me feel relaxed and at ease with the hair that was falling to the floor!

            "Review: My best friend was in town and after a long day of walking around visiting Montreal, we were look for an affordable, healthy, and not too busy of a restaurant. As we walked down St.Denis we came upon Au Pres de Ma Blonde. The menu proposed seemed like it would be a home cooked meal our mother would make.\\nWe walked in and it was so nicely architectured and the music playing was soothing and at the perfect volume. The waitress  took our order and we were served rather quickly. We each ordered a couscous plate and it was SO DELICIOUS. The portion was big but perfect to cut in a half and enjoy the meal yet again the next day. After we had finished the waitress did not pressure us to leave or pay the bill immediately. We were able to sit down and talk for a while feeling completely at home. What was also really nice is she was not constantly soliciting us. She asked once if we were ok, and let us enjoy our time together.\\nAbsolutely loved this restaurant and recommend to families as well as groups of  friends, or in intimacy. I cannot wait to go back soon!!!\n",

            "Review: This was one of the best stays I've had in Vegas so far.  The room was super clean and HUGE, especially for the average deluxe room on the strip.\\n\\nEven though the hotel itself is considered to be quite out of the way from the rest of the casinos on the strip, it offers more in their typical room than most other higher-scale casinos.  The additional square footage is definitely noticeable, along with having a 42\\\" HD plasma tv on the wall facing the beds, another smaller HD tv in the bathroom, ipod capable clock radio, his and her closets (!), his and her sinks, shower AND tub, a separated toilet, reading lights built into the beds, workspace, and a view of the pool area (Mandalay's backyard) to boot!\\n\\nThe hotel's casino is huge and it is quite a pleasant surprise to find the casino not completely filled with cigarette smoke as I've previously encountered at other hotels.  Instead, they've somehow replaced it with a subtle scent of fresh coconuts.  Their sportsbook is SPECTACULAR...one of the most impressive I've seen.  The casino level is also directly connected to THEhotel on one side and a mall that leads to Luxor and Excalibur, along with a ton of great restaurants, as well.  You basically never have to leave this resort -- it has everything you'd possibly need.\\n\\nOne thing I was disappointed with was the pillow-top beds...they were far too soft for a side-sleeper like myself.  (If you like firm, the beds at MGM Grand are the best!)  The quality of the bed sheets was low in comparison to those at MGM Grand, even when this hotel is supposed to be on a slightly higher scale.  For this reason, I can't give Mandalay 5 stars...yes, I put a lot of weight on beds, ha.\\n\\nFor those who aren't VIP (i.e. me)...imagine all this at the unbelievable rate of stay one night, get the next comped (!) as one of their promotions (came out to $50/night).  I bet there's no place on the strip that can possibly beat that two-fer!\\n\\nBig ups, MB!\n",

            "Review: RIBS RIBS RIBS! I like me some niceeee slab of ribs, drizzled in a tangy, but slightly sweet BBQ sauce. Smoky Jon's definitely delivered!! They held  true to their many awards (nicely displayed next to their register) and I was more than content once I finished eating.\\n\\nThe ribs themselves were just ordinary- pretty juicy, but nothing to blow my mind. What I found amazing was the sauce and the sides!!! The corn was deliciousss, especially all dressed up in their special seasoning. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted just like the ones I usually make at home, which are pretttty darn amazing- if I should say so myself.\\n\\nOne downfall was that there is a $4.00 plate splitting fee (BOOOOO!). I really wanted to try the 1/2 slab + sandwich + sides combo (only like 2 bucks more than just 1/2 slab) but I knew I couldn't finish it by myself... and it just wouldnt be worth it to pay $4.00 more to share it with a friend. Hmm... or maybe, next time don't be as dumb as me and say out loud you want to share.... sneakily share it at the table!!\\n\\nAnyways, Smoky Jon's was a great farewell from Madison meal for me, leaving me nice and full, the perfect prep for a long flight back to Los Angeles. \\nI'd give it a solid 4 stars.\n",

There are divey bars that are dirty and gross where I would never dream of touching the food. And then there are the divey bars that are just grungy enough to give it character, and where you feel just brave enough to try the food, and you are so glad that you did! The BBT is definitely the good kind of dive bar. \\nThe food here was way way better than I expected. The Polish specialties are spot on. By far the best perogies I've ever had, and the stuffed cabbage was incredible as well. I'm not usually one for kielbasa, but here it is a different story. Normally its greasy and chewy, but somehow at the BBT it comes out perfectly charred and super tender. \\nThere is something very PITTSBURGH about the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, and I will definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in town.\n",

I stood there and watched a little...cause like I said I no what im doing in a pizzeria...I watched your pizza guy mess up atleast 4 orders...u guys were busy and people were moving SO SLOW!!!! chatting around....ridiculous! and the lady in the front with the cigarette voice REALLY needs some more training.\\n\\nI watched another couple come in order food and beers...the women who took there order (cigarette voice lady) asked. \\\"oh y didn't u get a bucket? its cheaper.\\\" ummmmm probably cause they don't work there and u didn't tell them MORON!!! \\n\\nthe shenanigans I watched for over an hour was just unreal and we will not be back...which is a shame cause the food aint to bad at all....just goes to show u its more then just what the food taste like.\\n\\nim sure once this is read they will no exactly who this is just because of the two liter statement. which is fine...I hope you enjoy your last 40 from me :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin response to the owner****\\nnumber one yes bacon is fatty. but if u or ur staff knew anything...ud no to avoid disgusting looking bacon u either A. order Bacon bits from ur distributor or ur chop up ur own throw in a the deep fryer that was it looks presentable  unlike the slop ur business allowed to go out the door. into my home. number 2 yes u do have ONE SIGN at the front door about the 20$$ bill thing but go buy a pen so u don't look like a rude lazy owner. like I said I grew up in a pizzeria...I no what food cost is...we also used quality product...alot like ur products...i never once said u didnt have quality product...ur just straight up over charging. and ur right I have no other yelp post or friends cuz I specifically made this one just to tell people about ur business. I said what I needed to say...n im sure ur business will eventually downward spiral in the future. have a great day.\\n\\nfyi- arguing with me REALLY doesn't make u or ur business look any better.\n",

            "Review: I really wanted to like this place because it's a 5 minute walk from my house and I like coffee.\\n\\nI had a pour experience.  I felt completely out of place here and I got that look from the barista the, \\\"You sure you're in the right place \\\"look. :( that can really hurt a girls feeling.\\n\\nThe barista dropped the espresso tamper on the ground and then used it to make my coffee with. Now I am not a germ-a-phobe by any stretch of the imagination but I do believe that a customer should be treated with dignity and some common courtesy, anyone, anyone???\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I dined here together right before we left on vacation. When we got to Buena Vista Coffee there was only one other patron in the coffee shop and only one other person came into the be served while we were there for 20 minutes. \\n\\nI always like to dine at a near empty establishment, because I reason that if it's not too busy or crowded the server, cook, barista what have you can focus on doing a good job and not feel rushed.  \\nWell the opposite was true for my  visit to Buena Vista Coffee even though the coffee shop was completely empty the barista treated it as if there were a line of 30 customers behind me. Nothing necessarily being impatient but completely detached in that hipster sort of way. That if you're not a hipster can be pretty bleeping annoying.\\n\\nThis is me ranting!!! \\n\\nFirst by dropping the instrument where the espresso beans are tamped and then by serving me a breakfast sandwich that was barely luke warm with a cold piece of unmelted cheese on it.  I am beyond the point of desperation for a decent coffee house.  I am so utterly desperate to have a solid coffee establishment close to home\\n\\nBuena Vista's coffee only saving grace was the cappuccino.  It didn't taste like dirty coffee shop floor lol but the foam was thick and velvety and the coffee was so so.\n",

            "Review: After sampling two great oysters and a really tasty Parmesan Tater Tot during the Yelp Elite event in the Side Car, Diane and I decided to repay the favor by having a full dinner in P.J. Clarke's main dining room.  It was an eye opener, because before this meal I didn't know that this establishment was a fine bastion of comfort food. \\n\\nWe opened with what turned out to be the only discordant note of the evening: Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail.  The Cocktail Sauce was great, but for only 4 large shrimps at over $18 for the dish, the shrimp had better be great, too!  And, unfortunately for us and the rating for this review, these crustaceans were only mediocre.  Although they looked fine enough, they were tough, hard, and had little flavor.  But the meal was far from over, and I still kept an open mind after our stumbling start.\\n\\nWhat a great recovery!  The excellent French Onion Soup Gratinee that I was served was sweet and delicious--maybe the best I've ever savored of hundreds I've tried from coast to coast and around the world, since this is one of my favorite dishes and I order it almost every time I see it on a restaurant menu.  Our server, Anthony, said that the onions are sweated separately before they are put in the soup, and the cheese is a combination of Gruyere and Swiss, with the top browned with Parmesan.  As a photo reveals, this soup was bursting with cheese on the edges of the crock, and visible bubbles on the cheese covering glistened as if heralding that something special would be found inside.  Carefully breaking through the cheese with a knife, hot broth, a well-melted crouton, and well-caramelized onions came to view.  The broth was hearty and melded well with the cheese that fell inside along with the soup's other ingredients.  Not a hint of bitterness was detected in the dish.  The white crock in which the soup was served was large but I would not have minded if its bottom had been endless.\\n\\nNext for me was a Chicken Pot Pie.  It arrived in a white elongated dish that was shaped much like a shark.  The doughy top of the pot pie was tanned and taut.  It wasn't smoking at all.  But I needn't have been concerned.  For, when I broke through the thin crust, the contents were piping hot and truly delicious: a generous amount of white chicken meat, potato chunks, and carrot and celery bits, all combined in a tasty and creamy White Sauce.\\n\\nAfter recent repeated disappointments in landing a medium-rare hamburger at different establishments in town, Diane was thrilled with her medium-rare Cadillac Burger, containing tasty bacon and a slice of American Cheese.  When the cheeseburger was cut in half, you could clearly see the redness across the middle of the 8-oz. burger, as another photo discloses.  I tasted the burger, and it was juicy and delicious even on a plain bun, which is the way my vegetable-hating wife likes her burgers.  And, even the accompanying French Fries tasted great!  Plus, there are always the Tater Tots available to opt for next time.\\n\\nWe finished with a delicious shared Bread Pudding a la Mode finished with a very nice La Creme Bourbon Sauce that a diner can pour out to his or her desire, and Cinnamon Ice Cream.  The ice cream was pretty scanty, and we got through it before the dish was half-finished.  So, I requested more.  It was quickly brought to the table without extra charge.\\n\\nService by Anthony and his assistant was excellent throughout the meal.  Extra ice was even provided in an extra glass without request to refresh my Iced Tea.  Great comfort food at a high but fair price for the quality of ingredients, and everything prepared and baked in house!  This was a five-star experience except for our appetizer, which brought the overall rating down a notch.  Next time, it's oysters for me!  For, after this experience, there will definitely be a \\\"next time\\\" fairly soon.\n",

They were selling it as a whole chicken, cut up and I kind of suspected something when I noticed the cook was picking the chicken from some covered place and didn't see a whole chicken cut up in front of me!\\n\\nLeft over chicken from the day before should never be sold to customers and pass it as fresh chicken, they should be glad I didn't drive back and throw the chicken in their face.

            "Review: FIrst let me mention that I am a Chicago native and this means I know pizza.  This place serves the closest to Chicago style deep dish pizza I have found since leaving home.  (closer to Uno's and Connies than Giorgano's but we will take it). This could be because their other locations are all in Illinois. They also serve thin (sliced correctly, in squares), double crust, pan, and stuffed.  Upon being seated, the table receives (free) a basket of the most delightful garlic parmesan bread bites we have ever tasted.  These, plus a salad, would be enough for a normal person's dinner.  But no, get the pizza and take it home.  A medium deep dish will feed your house for the next few days, and warms up as delicious as first served.  Sadly, filling up on the bread and anticipating a pizza meal was not enough for us.  We also ordered the cheesy bacon fries.  We were overstuffed but not sorry.  These feature real bacon, two cheeses and dipping sauce.  We have never, ever, had fries this good.\\nThe restaurant is cute and comfortable with Italian country decor, but a bit small.  A large party with children came in when we were in mid meal and we were asked to move to a booth so they could push all the tables on one side of the room together. We did not mind moving, unfortunately the large party with children in the small space subjected us to learning much more about the lives and activities of them and their children than we ever wanted or needed to know. Size feels like a real restaurant in Italy without the outdoor seating.They provide linen napkins but no tablecloths.  The staff provided regular check-ins to see if we needed anything, refilled beverages without being asked and the food was served promptly. The server was extremely patient with an elderly foursome who did not understand their check or how to use an entertainment coupon (close quarters, we heard it all clearly).\\nIn summary, I would gladly chance the possibility of loud families in close quarters to feast on those delightful bread bites and the great pizza.\n",

Apparently, I'm not the only one seeing the crowd that was there on Thursday night, I don't think many people know about Bask so they possibly need to up the ante in that department. I checked this jewel of a place out at the Yelpy Hour and can't wait to go back for a real meal! Yelpers took over the bar area while there a few booths and seats occupied in the place by others. They have a seating area that looks right over the kitchen so you can watch them cook your meal while enjoying a drink along with booths lining the walls with tables in the middle of the restaurant. The setting is very chic and modern---no overwhelming or obscure artwork, music, what have you, it was just perfect. We had some nice drink specials offered to us plus an appetizer spread with delectable bites such as jalapeno poppers and black bean hummus. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a menu the size of the Cheesecake Factory, Bask isn't the place for you. They offer simple, classic dishes with a mix of comfort at affordable rates. Not like Denny's rates or anything but reasonably priced for the quality of ingredients they offer. I also found out they offer Sunday brunch so this could be an awesome place to stop at when you're looking to mix it up from the regular brunch establishments in the QC. They have a few parking spots in the front and parking in the back or you can park off the street. I imagine their patio would be a sweet place to plop down at while a concert is going on. All in all, a solid place that I look forward to trying again!\n",

The service was horrible, the decor obnoxious and the cupcake desserts were, I kid you not,  4/5th icing (seriously gross).  Our waitress was no newbie, but maybe she had too many tables, maybe she wasn't too bright or maybe she was just so slow that she couldn't recall the order by the time she got to the computer. She totally forgot our appetizer and I appreciate the fact that she owned up to it twenty minutes later.  By the time our food finally arrived, the pasta was cold, but we were so hungry we didn't send it back.  Stick to the carry out desserts.\n",

            "Review: On December 19, 2014, I noticed that my outdoor freezer had a puddle of water surrounding it. I quickly ran out to Lowe's in search of a replacement freezer. We have never been a fans of the Rock Hill Lowe's, so we went to the one in Fort Mill. They told us that they would look and see if they had any in stock. Well, turns out they did not have any in stock, but they would call the Rock Hill Lowe's to check for us. It was taking quite a while to hear back from the staff in Rock Hill, so we went ahead and drove over to the Lowe's in Rock Hill, while waiting on the one in Fort Mill to give us a call on our cell phone. Fort Mill had not called us in the 15 minutes it took us to get to Rock Hill, nor did they ever call at all to let us know an answer. We were not happy with Lowe's, so we searched other stores such as Sears and Home Depot. We finally found a store with a freezer in stock, but never did we hear a response from the Lowe's in Fort Mill. Very slow and inconsiderate service. In the future, while searching for appliance needs, I will stop at Sears and Home Depot.\n",

            "Review: You must try this place!!!  The interior is ok, I hope they upgrade the exhaust system since it smelled a little like a stinky-fried-food Chinese restaurant.  The first server we had was terrible, but it turns out it was his first day.  All the other servers are super knowledgeable and awesome. \\n\\nThe prices are super reasonable for the quality of food.  The Chef used to be the Executive Chef of Social House on the strip so he knows all the vendors and gets top notch ingredients.  The hubby is super sensitive to uni and if it's just a smidge not fresh he will pick up on it and claim it to be \\\"fishy\\\" or \\\"too slimy\\\".  He RAVED about the uni here and even ordered himself seconds!  Trust, this has never happened before (not even at Raku or Kabuto or Yonaka).  The chef is dedicated to making sure his food is extremely fresh and clean tasting. \\n\\nWe tried the yellowtail, the tostadas, beef tataki, angus gyoza, butter lettuce cod, and crispy rice tuna roll.  All were amazing, especially the yellowtail, tuna poke tostada, and cod (as well as some other nigiri and sashimi we had).  I would pass on the gyoza and crispy rice.  Gyoza was limp (and I guess I still prefer traditional pork) and a tad too greasy.  Crispy rice roll is a great concept, just didn't care for the actual crispy rice.  It was kind of stale and not crisp.  \\n\\nCan't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu - they also have HH.  The toastadas are only $1 each.  I might just have to go and get like 10 of the ahi poke toastadas.\n",

            "Review: AT&T UVerse\\n\\nI admit I have more motivation to complain about a service than write a compliment about it. But if I were looking at changing cable/internet/phone providers I would want to know this. \\n\\nI have had Time Warner Cable, Charter, and AT&T UVerse. Easily, I was the least satisfied with TWC. I recently left Charter once UVerse came into our area since it has the best to offer as far as DVR, channels provided for price (including promotions such as HBO, Showtime, Big Ten Network, NFL, MLB networks, etc), and the $150 gift card for signing up. Charter is better for high def TV (AT&T you pay extra), faster Internet, and unlimited phone and fax line is free if needed. Although faster Internet that Charter advertises may be overkill, as Consumer Reports recently noted that 15mbps is the most that the average consumer needs, and I get 18mbps with UVerse, which is slower than Charter. \\n\\nAT&T UVerse has the worst customer service by far. Recently I have had about a month of contacting the company (via telephone and on-line chat) for problems with transferring my phone number from Charter to UVerse. Something as simple as this still has not happened. The telephone customer service agents cannot give me anything in writing (no email, letter, anything), and cannot contact Charter directly, or if they do, they ask that I call Charter (already have 3 times). AT&T Uverse customer service agents have horrible documentation of the previous communications with their customers. They also call and leave messages that are so mumbled I cannot understand them. They also promise to call back at certain times then never call back. \\n\\nI was also promised my first bill would be $128 + tax, and the first time activation fee of $49 would be waived. My first bill is about $168, and no one appears to be able to address this fee or find documentation of this quote (and as above, AT&T does not provide anything in writing).\\n\\nSo if AT&T UVerse offers you a deal that sounds too good to be true, likely it is. And hope you don't have any problems with your service, because you are likely on your own.\n",

            "Review: We tried this restaurant because we are new to the neighborhood and love trying new places.  A few observations, wine prices were terribly exorbitant.  At $10 for a glass of no-name Riesling, I just can't seeing myself doing that again.  My family ordered 2 kids meals with grilled cheese, I had the Perfectly grilled cheese (reminded me of a Monte Cristo sans the meat) and my husband had a plate of Alfredo, for what we ordered  $65 including tip just seemed over the top.  I think this place wants to have a high end feel, but the lack of a formal bar (bottles were huddled together on the serving line) and the male owner walking around in FLIP FLOPS, detracts from the high-end feel (think Postino's) that this restaurant wants to achieve.  A few suggestions for the owners (who I recognized from their picture in the paper): DRESS PROFESSIONALLY, and introduce yourselves as the owners so you can get constructive feedback from your patrons.  You'd think that the owners are embarrassed for anyone to know the place is theirs.  Next, move the alcohol behind the counter so you can at least PRETEND you have an actual bar, and please offer wine specials, most people (like me) like to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and if that part of my dining experience is cost prohibitive, then I won't go to that restaurant for the food.  Next, turn the music down.  Dining is a social experience and if I can't hear people at my table, I'd rather just go somewhere else.  Finally, improve the customer service, your waitresses (and the female owner) dropped things on the table then ran off before we could ask for things like napkins, condiments, etc.  I thought this type of service was very unprofessional and makes me hesitant to return.  Overall, this place has excellent food.  I hope they can make some minor tweaks to their establishment so that they can hang around for the long haul and be a place people can go to in Ahwahtukee for a great meal!\n",

            "Review: Don't let the Pizza Hut exterior fool you; this is a decent place to grab a quick, fresh and cheap sushi combo lunch. \\n\\nHave been a few times with friends and mostly order the Sushi A combo for $8.95, which gets you two maki rolls (generally go with the California and Spicy Tuna), a ginger salad, and an egg roll. The ginger dressing here is quite good, but be sure to ask for it on the side unless you want your lettuce literally drowning in ginger goodness. The veggie egg roll isn't too greasy and the sushi is average but fresh. All this for $8.95 makes it a great lunch deal if you're in the Cotswold area. \\n\\nA must have if you aren't ordering off of the combo menu is the Cherry Blossom roll. It's the best roll I've had at Koishi and comes out looking like a flower, which gives it a little extra something, in my humble opinion. \\n\\nService is a bit on the slow side but generally friendly. And there is plenty of parking on the side and behind the building. Only gripe is that it's tough to get in/leave with the barrier in center of Sharon Amity and the no U-turn signs, but no worries; it's worth the bit of extra maneuvering.\n",

            "Review: Was here for a convention.  The bathrooms in the convention area were spacious and clean.  However, the lunch breaks offered very little for the people with any dietary restrictions.  Even my local sandwich shop in Austin TX can make me a sandwich with gluten free bread.....not so much in Vegas.  I ate salads for lunch and eggs/bacon for supper mostly as I was too tired to find a good restaurant with a chef that can do gluten free/dairy free.  Thought the gambling area smelled like smoke, so I didn't do any gambling there.  Since my only other experiences in Vegas are either at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the Mirage is average at best IMHO.\\n\\nUpdate later that same year:  Girls weekend in Vegas for 4 ppl.  Reservations made all together on one credit card and one name so they are linked together.  Requested adjoining/connecting rooms as this was a girls weekend.  When we arrived the reservations were NOT linked.  They did not have us in adjoining or connecting rooms.  They did NOT alter that fact, nor did they seem to care that this was inconvenient or a problem.  They did not address it or offer any compensation for this HUGE inconvenience.  It really affected the trip that if two of us went up and were not the two sharing the same room, then we either had to be apart or cart items between the rooms...same goes for sharing accessories, having morning coffee, etc.  It was just a drag.  The Mirage was seemingly unaware of how girls weekends operate.  Their attitude was uncaring and I will NEVER go back.  Why make a reservation for two rooms in advance if the reservation itself is not honored?  Why pay a reservation hold fee if it isn't holding what you want?  Why go out of town for a girls weekend, if you can't spend the weekend with the girls?  We did have fun, but the inconvenience was a bit dampening.  If you expect good customer service go to the Bellagio, if you want clean rooms and no service, then stay here.\n",

Tea Infusion would be a great off-the-street place to go. I can see it situated in the LGO or Central/Camelback Ave or Biltmore area. Or even tucked neatly off Mill Ave. If it were in any other place but Tempe Marketplace, I'd become a regular - especially because they have free wifi.\\n\\nI ate lunch here today with a friend. We both commented on the striking decor - the soothing blue/gray walls and dark wood. There are even a couple of quotes painted on the walls, along with vibrant art hanging on display. \\n\\nTea Infusion also sells tea cups, mugs and tea pots. But is that really why you'd stop in? No. You'd stop in to sample the tea, check out the menu and wager if you'll like this place. At least that's what I did. \\n\\nI like this place quite a bit, for the tea selection is large. From black to white to chai to oolong, you have many possibilities to satiate your tea appetite. I ordered a hot pot (two cups worth) of their chocolate mint chai. I also ordered egg, cheese and ham on an english muffin (from their breakfast menu, which is served all day). The tea arrived shortly with a little orange hour-glass, which is used to tell me when the tea is ready (3 minute seep is standard). Once the sand fell down to the bottom, I poured the tea into my glass. And I sipped. It was just the thing to offset the chilly afternoon. \\n\\nMy sandwich arrived later. It was just okay. I nibbled on it happily, though. My friend ordered the Tuscan chicken sandwich, which came with an artichoke sort of tapenade and a small splattering of goat cheese. She said the multi-grain bread was delicious. We both encountered a small problem though: our sandwiches wanted to fall apart. A piece of mine even leapt from the table onto the floor. Messy. \\n\\nBeing one of the few patrons there, we were able to relax, slowly drink our tea and enjoy a free-flowing conversation. Then it happened. A fresh, organic fruit tart appeared and we just had to have it. My friend quickly jumped up to order one for us. In order to make room in the display case, the girl behind the counter offered up a sampling of some chocolate truffle-like dessert. I gladly snatched up a sliver for us to try. And then we melted into the pleasures of fresh, organic fruit on top of a sweet custard surrounded by a flaky crust. There was also the bliss of the chocolate treat. \\\"This would be absolutely perfect with coffee,\\\" I said. My friend agreed, for the chocolate dessert was the perfect amount of cream and cocoa to complement a cup of hot coffee. \\n\\nI would recommend this place for a brunch or afternoon escape. While the lunch menu does offer up sandwich and salad options, I think you'd do better sticking with the obvious: the tea.\n",

It is relatively clean, but I find that the people who work here are incredibly uninformed and do not communicate with one another.\\n\\nToday, I went in for a replacement phone charger because I had a blonde moment and left it somewhere where I won't be able to retrieve it for a week. Now, I know that my phone is micro USB, so this shouldn't be challenging, right? \\n\\nMe: \\\"This one should work, correct?\\\"\\n\\nOverenthusiastic Teen Employee: \\\"Umm, I dunno. It is a different brand and your phone is pretty new.\\\" *hopeful smile*\\n\\nShe runs off to confer with her other employees, who are lounging haphazardly around the mobile accessories area (must be nice). She comes back and picks up a car charger. I shake my head and remind her that I am looking for a wall adapter. We go though this a couple of times, but eventually, I just go with my gut. \\n\\n\\nOverenthusiastic Teen Employee: \\\"Oh, those are on sale, two for $29.99.\\\" *points to sign*\\n\\nMe: \\\"I only need one. Then again, I might have another stroke of genius, so maybe I will keep one at work.\\\" (Yeah, she got me.)\\n\\nSo, I bop around the store, but don't find anything else that I'm terribly interested in. I make my way to the register and go through checkout.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the sale did not ring up. I mention this to the clerk, who radios in the query. A few minutes go by without response and she asks again. I know that there are three people standing in mobile accessories, but at this point, I tell her to forget it and just go with the original one I came in for. \\n\\nThis is not the first time I have encountered price discrepancies and lack of communication at this particular location.

They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.\\n\\nI tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the \\\"premium\\\" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. \\n\\nEven that, I can write off to personal preference.\\n\\nWhat really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. \\n\\nIt's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. \\n\\nOn the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. \\n\\nI don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). \\n\\nMy worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the \\\"kitchen\\\" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...\\n\\nI've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.\\n\\nMaybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden...\n",

I'm sorry but burgers are 100% about perfect proportioning of quality ingredients.  If you want to make a bigger bugger, make it bigger in a direction that makes sense.  Burgers are my favorite food, but I was not thrilled by this place.  Stack'd in shadyside is better for 1/4 the price.  Also the restaurant was freezing cold!  I was sat at a teeny high table where our plates could barely fit even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  I didn't like the way the burgers were served also, they were crammed in a tiny basket that made it hard to eat.  Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, but there are so many other places nearby that will give you better food/atmosphere for a fraction of brgr price.\n",

            "Review: Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\\\"well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\\\". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \\\"uneventful\\\" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience.\n",

I would probably have one of the best Asian restaurants in all of Las Vegas. \\n\\nThe issue with Asian restaurants in general is the poor service. It can really put a damper in your dining experience. Instead of hiring experienced waitresses who can clearly understand what you're saying and be attentive throughout the meal, many Asian joints hire their nieces and/or other family members, or perhaps even random attractive Asian girls. \\n\\nLet's just say, Ichiza... you have phenomenal Japanese food. Authentic and not overpriced, with an extensive variety offered all over the walls and on the menu. Your ramen is definitely better than Monta's (at least that's my opinion). I will always crave your curry udon, pork and onion skewers, fresh oysters, and pretty much everything else offered in that tiny space of a restaurant ;)   But please, please, please work on the service aspect! \\n\\nOn the several occasions I've been to this restaurant, my group and I waited about 15+ min to be approached after seating. We watch hungry and thirsty as the 2 or 3 waitresses on duty walk by, bus tables, stare at other tables, giggle in the back, or just plain stand around. We usually have to flag someone down to inform her that we're ready to order and once we do, we feel rushed and it is rather difficult to communicate half the time. The food takes a little longer than the average Asian restaurant, which is ok... but once it's out, don't expect to see your waitress again. Or.. you will see her walking around, but she won't acknowledge your existence. Good luck on refills! \\n\\nLast night was a prime example. We had 4 of us in the group. We finally ordered our dishes, they came out after some time, then we had a 5th join us. Long story short, he did not have a chance to order anything at all, not even a glass of water. \\n\\nNeedless to say, this place has fabulous food, and it's adorable on the inside... very Japanese :). Workers are polite but lack any restaurant experience. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars strictly due to service! I sure hope that aspect improves because then it would certainly be a 5 star experience all around!\n",

We call wondering what we did wrong and they tell us that they are closed because of storm damage. It happens. This would be completly understandable and they would still have 4 stars. However, no one notified us. Any of us and we all get emails and text updates from them regularly. How hard would it have been to send a blanket email saying we apologize for the inconvienence but we have to cancel this weekends shows due to storm damage. Not only did we arrive to find this out, but the people on the phone were like oops. Not I am so sorry, we will have someone contact you to remedy this, nope. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Oops is not an acceptable answer. \\n\\nThis is not an acceptable level of service and so very dissappointing from a local treasure. Customer service is not that hard. A text, email, anything and I would not be writting this review. I would be writting a much different account. I am actually really sad. Oh well. Time to try one of the other local comedy clubs we now have. Gotta love competition, they now have my buisness.\\n\\nThey have contacted me this week to try to remedy this. I will be giving them another try and will write a review update when I go back.\n",

            "Review: Ling & Louie, hmmm, I'm having a bit of hard time to define this place. The menu serves a wide range of Asian foods, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese (from my first glance of the dishes and its names), then there is a full bar, Happy Hour menu such as Asian fusion 'flatbread' and 'tacos', it just made me more confused, a place serves many kinds of Asian food but nothing is specialized? Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'! So yeah, this is a bar with many kinds of Asian fusion foods. Do not come if you are craving for a more authentic asian cuisine, that was my mistake, yeah...\n",

I had two martini's, one dirty and one straight up, both were good.  The dirty could have been more dirty.  Husband got a mixed drink with the rum, still good. A little small, but I think the portions depend on what drink you order. Best just to ask the bartender and tell them what specifically you are looking for in a drink.  \\n\\nFood came out very quickly.  Ordered the Calamari, skip that one next time. The Maui Burger, great! It seemed as if it was made with a little bit of sausage, not a bad thing, a unique taste that was refreshing.  Spareribs, also good. Tender.  Catfish taco was the winner.  They only give you one, order more than one. Hands down though, best flavor of the night. Can't be beat for $2.  We ate for $9 total and drank for $21 dollars, we were done in about an hour.

As long as it is packed it won't change and it could be great. The service is almost non existent. Be prepared to wait for everything, starting with a hostess the minute you walk in. The last time I ate there I had to go get silver wear and a menu myself. The menu tries hard but doesn't quite make the mark and the prices are high. Finally, beware of the ever changing beer prices in the cooler near the entrance. Signs clearly mark that beers are 6 for $8.95, but some employees charge more for certain beers even though that are not marked as such. After spending my Father's Day morning trying to make a special six pack for my husband and getting denied even though signs are everywhere and they had not pulled these shenanigans for the same beers before, I will not be returning. The McDonalds in the parking lot would be better food and service.\n",

            "Review: We tried two dishes: Lomo a Caballo (beef strip saute) and Tallarin Saltado de Pollo (linguine with chicken). The best part of the beef plate was probably the fried plantains, which were savory and sweet at the same time. The gravy/drippings also had a good flavor, which spread into the rice, french fries, beef, and vegetables. A couple of the beef strips were raw and therefore could not be eaten safely, which makes me wary of the quality control in the kitchen. The chicken dish had better spices and a similarly good gravy for the noodles. However, the flavors in both dishes were subtle overall. They had a nice home-cooked feel, but didn't blow us away or give us a desire to visit again. There was a nice starter placed on the table, which consisted of some kind of hollow, dried corn pieces and two tzatziki-like dipping sauces (one mild, one spicy). This was an interesting and pleasant dish to try while we waited a very long time for our food. \\n\\nWhile the food was pretty good, the ambiance and service were not. The dining area was completely chaotic, with one assistant constantly running around moving tables and chairs... even our own after we had already been seated. There were tables noisily sliding around, chairs flying over my head, and my shoulders constantly being bumped by the two workers whizzing by in the cramped dining space. My other concern is the lack of cleanliness. The floors, tables, walls, etc. looked like they were not cleaned or maintained regularly, which is a health and sanitary concern. Ultimately, we waited about 15 minutes for anything to drink and nearly an hour for our food. The service was unacceptably disorganized and inefficient. \\n\\nI can't speak to how this food stacks up against other Peruvian cuisine. The dishes were pretty good, although I would like stronger spices and flavors. The environment and service were poor. Overall, these items make it very unlikely that I would visit again.\n",

When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.\\n\\nIf you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer. Cabo's didn't feel that way. At I could have received the same dinner for half the price but with a lot more flavor.\n",

It is a little on the pricey side for the evening admission (the day time is without monsters and just a walk through) there is a guy out front that hands out a $5 discount, so it's manageable. I asked if there was anything we could do for additional discount because it was my friend's 30th birthday. They couldn't do an additional discount, but they gave us a few 2-for-1 drink discounts. The place was a lot of fun too, it's a decent walk through, with a lot of attention to detail. The actors are really fun and really get into their characters. They're not afraid to be rude to you and fully get into things. A lot of places that do stuff like this hold back, but this one was really a lot of fun. I know some people say it's not worth the price, but if this is the sort of thing you are into you'll appreciate the acting and the details and it IS in fact worth it. Also, the people running it are SUPER nice and awesome. My friend and I both bought a picture at the end and they printer was having issues, so we only got the first picture out and they were working on the printer. It was closing and I felt bad, so I asked if I could just pay the difference and get a hat. They just let me have the hat, mind you, the second picture is only $5 extra and a hat is like $20. So my friend and I leave and we're like 8 stores down the line as they come running out to us because they got the printer working and gave us our picture. So we got a hat for free and they RAN out and found us to give us the picture. I've never had service that nice ANYWHERE. I totally recommend this place, for the scares, the atmosphere, and the AWESOME people!\n",

            "Review: If all you want to read is this first sentence, then here's all you really need to know: try their weekend brunch and order the Tofu Scramble. \\n\\nTofu is one of those ingredients that half the world lives in fear of. Another small percentage of the population will brag about the tofu salad they had at lunch, though we all know they had to choke it down. There are then people who have experienced tofu done right and thus genuinely love the stuff. Trust that after trying the Tofu Scramble at Mickey's, you will fit into the latter group of the tofu world. \\n\\nWhat makes this tofu so wonderful is that it's marinated in peanut butter. It's special. A common complaint with this often dismissed soy product is its tendency to taste bland if not prepared correctly. When it's cooked up at Mickey's with just the right amount of rich peanut butter, this worry is null and void. Add to this flavor packed mixture some saut\\u00e9ed spinach, sweet red pepper, and red onion and it's no wonder this dish is known for winning over anti-tofu folks. The fresh produce cuts the intensity of the peanut buttered tofu and offers great contrast in terms of color and texture as well. \\n\\nThough it's only served Saturday and Sunday, the Tofu Scramble is so wonderful you'll be craving it all week long.\n",

We also  looked over their large selections of  dried chiles  for my chili carne I am working on.

            "Review: Reviewing an animal hospital is a challenge, but so necessary! I've never been a fan of hospitals that have a multitude of vets on staff because of the impersonal atmosphere but several years ago, when my pet was sick, I felt it best to have several vets available to give second opinions. Could not have made a better decision with choosing Sunridge!\\n\\nWe have gone through it all here and, no matter what doctor we see, we have been happy owners. Our primary vet is Dr. Snead (who reminds me of a sensitive Chris Rock) but we have had several mini-emergencies where Dr. Rosa tended to our care and she is FAB too (reminds me of Chef Lorena Garcia a bit). \\n\\nAbout 9 months ago, we had a BIG emergency...hesitant that the Animal Emergency Center would charge us thousands I took a chance and called Sunridge at 9pm - the answering service was on the line and 20 minutes later an emergency doctor was unlocking the front doors and provided stiches and xrays - having us to return the next day for payment and follow up, etc. WOW! Unbelievable!\\n\\nA few flaws is that it is generally crowded with staff frantically swapping computer terminals, no separate entrances for dogs/cats/exotics (yes, they service exotics), and sometimes it takes a minute for your payment to be processed and file to be found. But the care you receive in exchange is worth it!\n",

There's like six flavors of barbecue sauce on the table. It comes to around twelve bucks with iced tea.\\n\\nWhat I don't like about this Famous Dave's is the service. It's hit or miss...mostly miss.

After a week, we had not heard anything so we stopped by to see what was up. Then Cassidy said they could not find a financing option for the deal he proposed and we all signed, so he wanted his car back.  OK,  how can you come up with a deal and then after 1 week decide that it just isn't going to work and then ask for the car back!!!  WTF!  The dealership should know what is going to fly or not.

            "Review: From reading all the reviews I was kinda freaking out about my flight but honestly people it's not that bad.  I flew from LV to San Diego.  I can handle anything for 1 hour.\\n\\nOne thing I notice from the posts is the displeasure of seating room and the extra costs.  The seats are tight - no doubt about that but you can add their roomier seats for something like $13 each way & they're huge.  I sat in the regular seats which weren't great but bearable.  I think you have to put things in perspective.  You get what you pay for.  If you want cheap air you're going to give up a little.\\n\\nAnother thing people complained about is the baggage fees.  If you plan ahead you're good.  Just pay for a checkin bag and you will have no problems. Also, you get a carry on item.  I had a back pack and no one said anything.   Again, this has to do with planning.\\n\\nI would say if you're looking for a short flight that is half the price of Southwest it's a good deal.  If not then you should book S.W. or some other carrier.  If you are looking for a deal and \\\"PLAN AHEAD\\\" then this is a good alternative or if it's last minute you can save a little.  \\n\\nNow that being said the worst thing I can say is I didn't care for the staff.  No smiles, little bit of attitude etc.  - oh and french accents for the whole staff (kinda annoying).  \\n\\nThe biggest annoyance is the people who sat near me and complained or made snide remarks about the extra costs and fees.  People - you have a choice.  This isn't some third world country where you only have one nationalized airline.  You can book somewhere else.  If you book it deal with it just don't get on a cheap flight acting like you're a priority first class passenger.  You're going cheap know your place.\\n\\nHope this helps.  good luck.\n",

Did not like that although I required assistance with boarding, when I asked for a set change from middle seat, I was given the absolute last row on the plane. Spent the night listening to two air hostesses talking about their lives. They could have told me that in the first place and I would have stayed where I was, instead of being completely uncomfortable for 4 hours. I don't like them compared to other airlines, but they had a flight that suited my schedule.\n",

We were staying at Mandalay Bay for the night, there for the Silversun Pickups/Muse concert (awesome, by the way) later that night so we made reservations for StripSteak. \\n\\nYes, the duck fat fries were very good. I preferred the truffle oil fries, the others didn't seem all that different than regular seasoned fries to be honest. I absolutely loved the richness of the potato focccacia bread. For appetizers we went with crab louie with avocado lettuce cups and the lobster, bacon-wrapped fritters. The crab cups were so fresh and came with a great spicy sauce...very refreshing and bite sized (especially after the heavy amuse).  The lobster fritters were served on a stick and came with a great, light, almost frothy lemon dipping sauce to roll into the lettuce. Again, light and refreshing, especially for something that was fried. \\n\\nWhat was not light was the rest of the meal. I ordered the ahi, seared rare, very delicious and well seasoned for not being blackened. Sides were truffle mac and cheese and bacon creamed spinach. To die for! I am not a mac and cheese person, but figured I'd give it a try, and love it! I was so upset with myself for filling up and not being able to finish everything! I really tried so hard. My date got the prime rib, which he enjoyed as well. \\n\\nI wish I could review a dessert here, but no room left in the tummy. Great combination of having a nice dinner without being frou-frou on the food or portions. If you're in Vegas, it's a must-do!\n",

Not bad!\\n\\nI took a peek at the menu, and immediately thought this place was kind of having an identity crisis. Like, there was sushi, but the menu seemed chinese, but there was pad thai. I dunno...maybe this was asian food for George Bush (like...\\\"ooh, it sounds exotic...must be asian\\\"). I got some sashimi to start, and then some chow fun for dinner. Two other people in my group got the all you can eat sushi.\\n\\nNot going to lie, the chow fun was pretty solid. The sashimi was hit or miss...one order was great, the other tasted not quite so fresh. However, the people that ordered all you can eat sushi got screwed hard. The service was exceptionally slow, and they would only let you order a very limited number of super boring rolls at a time. Therefore, although the peeps who got this were still hungry, we left anyways since we didn't want to wait a million hours for boring sushi.\\n\\nOur waiter was pretty clueless too...they very clearly did not know their menu very well, or what was in/came with many of the items. Bummer. Price wasn't horrific, I think I paid $35 sans drink.\\n\\nI dunno if I'd go back.

Glad I did my homework though because what could have been a VERY expensive visit ended up not being so bad. \\n\\nThe slides and kids' area is well staffed although a tad bit micromanaged. I get it because safety MUST be a priority but there is a fine line that must be hard to dance around. We went in the middle of the week and the lines weren't terrible, but as the day wore on, it got pretty crowded. The Lazy River is a bit TOO lazy for my taste, but the wave pool is fun and the little kids' play area is just right for a variety of age groups. \\n\\nHere are the tips I was given to make W-n-W a fun visit that won't break the bank. \\n\\n1) Get there early so you can get a spot in the shade. This is critical because well...Arizona is hot. (duh)\\n\\n2) Pack your own lunch in a cooler to leave in your car. When you want to eat, go out to the car and enjoy a picnic lunch there. This saved me AT LEAST $100 because food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. \\n\\n3) You CAN bring in sealed water bottles to the park. Sippy cups have to be empty so unless you are breastfeeding, don't expect your little ones to have their juices or anything like that brought in.\\n\\n4) WEAR FLIP FLOPS or AQUA SOCKS. The ground is searing and when you are waiting to get on some of these slides, your feet will melt off--literally-if you aren't wearing shoes. \\n\\n5) Save-Around guide has discount coupons if you're only going once and Luke AFB has discounts for Vets and current military. However, if you are planning to go multiple times this summer, the summer pass is worth it. \\n\\n6) Only bring in what you absolutely need. Lockers are pricey and if you buy your tickets online, you won't even need to bring in your wallet and can lock it in the trunk of your car. \\n\\n7) Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. Oh and sunscreen.\n",

            "Review: STATE BOARD OF COSMETOLOGY NEEDS TO VISIT! RED FLAGS! BEWARE!\\nThis place has the appearance of a nice clean and well kept salon.  I have been a few times but NEVER AGAIN.\\n\\nShort Massage: They offer a menu w/ a break down of what the service includes.  I always felt like the massage was much shorter so on my last visit I decided to time it w/ the stop watch on my iPhone.  It was half as long as it should have been but they charge you for it.  Make sure you are getting what you are paying for if you go for an upgraded pedicure.\\n\\nReckless: Very aggressive w/ the metal cheese grater looking tool they use on everyone's feet.  There is a more gentle way of getting the dead skin off of your feet ladies.  This rough and aggressive approach is very dangerous.  \\n\\nCuticles: They cut the cuticles way to close to the skin which isn't necessary.  Your cuticles are there for a reason. Trimming the cuticles can break the seal that protects the surrounding skin from infection.  You should just get your cuticles pushed back but not cut off.\\n\\nSanitation: They bring the tools out in what looks like a \\\"sterile bag\\\" that a hospital would keep scalpels in.  They open the bag in front of you which is a false sense on security because my guy placed the instruments back into the bag and pinched the end closed when he was done w/ my pedicure.  I don't know what he did with the tools after that? Did he bring the same tools out of that bag for the next person without sanitizing them properly? Were they clean when he peeled the bag open for me? The bag looks clean but I am curious if they just slide dirty instruments back into a \\\"sterile looking\\\" bag so it looks clean to a new customer?\\n\\nDirty Bowl: I got a manicure and the lady grabbed a bowl from under the sink and filled it with warm water.  I soaked my fingers in the bowl which had glass stones in the bottom.  She cut my natural nails so SHORT! I wanted to keep the length and just wanted them evened up...to late for that since she clipped the first two so short  without asking how I wanted them.  When she finished the manicure she went to the sink, put her hands on the stones to keep them in the bowl, and then dumped the water down the drain.  Then she put the bowl w/ stones back under the sink.  I am suspecting they don't sanitize the bowl or stones between manicures and just store it under the sink.  The thought of someone else's cuticles and nail clippings in the stones is disgusting! \\n\\nThey are very pushy with the upgrades for gel nails, nail art, waxing, deluxe pedicures etc... Beware if you go here.  You may be at risk of an infection.\\n\\nhttp://cosmetology.nv.gov/Consumers/Nail_Salon_Guide\n",

The decor is very minimalistic, that's okay it's a pretty casual burger joint and I was meeting a friend here for lunch so I'm not expecting much ambiance or else something has gone terribly wrong.\\n\\nSo you saunter up to that counter and you have a couple of choices for burgers. I chose the classic with veggie frites cause those sounded pretty cool. Well the burger's the most decent burger I've ever had. It was filling and unmemorable, well maybe I'm to blame for that maybe I shouldn't order a classic burger if I want my taste buds titillated. Veggie frites? I was expecting something like crispy vegetables and they kind of ended up being a fairly small portion of oily limpdick veggies, at least they're salted nicely.\\n\\nTotal bill for lunch? $9 I might as well go to a nicer restaurant and pony up the extra $1 for a much more awesome burger. However when I'm in the Stonecrest area this will do in a pinch.\n",

Not the best Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten in, but a worthy one nonetheless.\\n\\nAs far as atmosphere goes, the interior here is a bit more \\\"casual\\\" than most Chinese restaurants. Most of this interior decor feels more like something that belongs at Denny's or IHOP. Fortunately, there isn't a whole lot of excess noise either. During my last visit, a TV behind the counter was showing Seinfeld - not complaining or anything, but if you want an authentic Chinese experience, atmosphere and all, this isn't the place for you.\\n\\nBut the food is what counts, and each time I have been here, I have had no complaints with it. They have a large, diverse menu - quite possibly one of the largest of its kind. Regardless of your tastes in Chinese food, I'm sure you'll find something you like here. \\n\\nChina Inn doesn't really do anything to stand out amongst the other Chinese restaurants in town, but with food items this solid I could care less. Definitely worth stopping by if you're a fan of Chinese food and are in the \\\"Old Henderson\\\" area.\n",

Another thing to note is most of the oyster shells didn't look like there was any attempt to clean or scrub them before opening as they had dirt and grime all over it. All management offered was a refund on the oysters, and gave us 3 of their \\\"premium and cleanest\\\" oysters that they had to offer. I felt like our entire meal should have been comp'ed. Other people in our party a variety of tacos and everyone agreed that they wasn't anything special about them. Midway through our meal, they dimmed the lights and turned on some club music, but there wasn't enough people in the bar/restaurant for that type of \\\"ambience\\\".

She loved it and I got to eat my meal (which was amazing) in it's entirety.  After that, we split a small dessert, which came out HUGE.\\n\\nRight about the time that we had both finished eating, we hear the waitress inform another party that since it was Wednesday that all food was 50% off for a promotion they were running.  EXCUSE ME?!\\n\\nSo, we got great service, great food and only paid $16.00 for two meals and a dessert.  I was incredibly impressed by that.  Additionally, it's so close to my house that I intend to be a regular fixture at this place!\n",

            "Review: Living up to try and be the next 'Ahhnold' (an Asian one anyway) or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (I am known in many circles as 'The Pebble'), I do enjoy my breakfast.  And I love, love, love eggs!  It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!\\n\\nThe Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  \\n\\nThe day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\\n\\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\\n\\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \\\"Breanne's Basics\\\" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \\\"Eggs With Attitude\\\" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \\\"The Benedicts\\\" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \\\"Fluffy & Folded\\\" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \\\"Sin City Skillets\\\" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \\\"From the Griddle\\\" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \\n\\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\\n\\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\\n\\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!\n",

            "Review: Finally made my long-awaited return, and... okay, not really. I just wanted a cold, sweet treat and didn't want to drive out elsewhere.\\n\\nI enjoyed this even more than last time. This time, I tasted some of the flavors that I didn't recognize, and I lucked into some really good ones. The first was the gansito, which the employee said is kinda a strawberry / chocolate version of a twinkie (and even had the fluffy cake part). Really enjoyed it except for how my plastic spoon was really doing an awful job at actually separating small pieces of ice cream from the larger mass. Luckily, it did not have a thick and gooey mouth feel, just a creamy and cold one.\\n\\nThe second flavor that I ate was the rompope, or Mexican eggnog. It definitely has that eggnog quality, but what's more interesting is the presence of raisins. Since Google tells me that rompope probably has rum (\\\"rom\\\") in it, I'm going to call this the Mexican version of rum raisin, which is my favorite classic flavor. Well, except more eggy. I liked it a lot too, and the texture was easier to handle with the spoon.\\n\\nPrices are just fine for ice cream. One scoop (\\\"chico\\\") is $2.50, two scoops (\\\"mediano\\\") are an almost paltry $3.50, and there's a grande size at $5 that I'm sure will fill me up if I ever get around to trying it. I think the cones are actually free, so I'd definitely suggest get a cone and use your tongue instead of a feeble spoon.\\n\\nSure, maybe they've had some run-ins with the health department, but doesn't everybody? I have not had diarrhea yet and I'm sure I'm more untidy with the ice cream in my own fridge. Also, it wasn't nearly as warm as last time (possibly owing to earlier time of day, or their fan and whatever A/C is doing work). I will definitely be back when I'm in the area, and I might even try some of the popsicles or mixed desserts next time.\n",

Overall all i can say was what a bad experience. \\n\\n    From the start i called to make a reservation as stated on the  Groupon but was told no reservation needed. As my friend and i walk in 808 sushi the only available seating was the sushi bar and a table next to the door, we took the table next to the door even though we were already cold. ( the table wasn't cleaned off). As we waited for them to clean off the table i look around and it seemed cold and dark, not a welcoming place.\\n    The server asked if we were doing happy hour or groupon, we told her groupon and she handed us the menu for the Groupon. :(. I was very dissapointed about the menu, i expected more variety of Rolls and appetizers. After ordering we over heard a table talking about still being hungry and complaining about waiting over 15min for their check. \\n      When it was our time to get our check we waited less than 10 min. We order 2 California rolls, 808 Roll, 6 piece Screaming orgasm , miso soup, shrimp tempura. total was$ 48.75 with Groupon discount it came to $8.75. I gave them $20.75 after waiting another 10min for my change back i got back only $9.75 :/ ya i was confused for a moment myself (i guess they wanted to take some of their own tip out of my money first). honest mistake maybe !!! .

But it's the service that I was impressed by. Art, the owner, seems to really take interest in each customer that crosses his path. It's a breath of fresh air and something you might not see at the chain next door. \\n\\nI enjoyed my Roasted Turkey sandwich. I'm picky about cold cuts (I've basically signed an exclusive with Boars Head) and these made the grade. The bread tastes freshly baked too. The mozzarella sandwich is tasty too. Thumbs up on the turkey chili as well, can't beat it on a chilly day. If you get a drink be prepared, they're basically in vat size cups. They offer your typical 1/2 sandwich & soup lunch specials as well.\\n\\nTo touch again on the great service, on my last visit Art literally sat down with me and chatted it up. It was the end of the lunch hour and the place was pretty much empty. He asked about my job, how I like downtown etc etc. So friendly! Hell, I might even just come back for the conversation! You should stop in and say hi. One of the few lunch places downtown where you don't have to have a fanny pack to fit in, this cafe is worth a try.\n",

So I did some research and found this jewel of a restaurant in a run-down mall on Twain and Swenson.\\n\\nThe restaurant is modestly decorated with some traditional Ethiopian art, and they even have a legit Ethiopian coffee experience you can purchase for about $15 I think?  They also had a stage in the restaurant so I'm assuming they have live music at specific times as well.\\n\\nThe food was good, but it's an acquired taste.  The bread was a bit sour for my taste buds, but the chicken was good and deliciously marinated.  Although it wasn't fitted for my taste, I respect the fact that the food was not standardized to appeal to average consumers; It's as real of an Ethiopian dish you can get.  I can see that it may be highly enjoyable after I build an acquired taste for it.\\n\\nI gotta say the service was wonderful, and that's what earned the fourth star for me.  The server greeted us and constantly filled our waters, helped us with whatever we needed, and even other people eating engaged in conversations with us.

            "Review: My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot. \\n\\nWhen you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu. \\n\\nThere is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic. \\n\\nThe food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread. \\nNext came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.\\n\\n Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in. \\n\\nThe fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.\\n\\nThis place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood. \\n\\nSo if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot.\n",

Happily, BNYCP has a roll of paper towels on each table-when they bother to put a fresh roll out. We waited For. Ev. Er. to order. We were finally able to order our 8 slices-we couldn't decide whether to get whole pies or not, and reading some of the reviews, I'm glad we didn't. They put two slices on one \\\"plate,\\\" so not everyone got a plate. \\n\\nThe pizza itself was not that great. There was lots of sticky, sweet sauce soaking through the crust and dripping off the large and flimsy slices. I'm glad to see someone was able to get a fork-we tried, but we were told we could only get a fork if we ordered a salad. Nice touch! Meanwhile, sauce is dripping off the pizza to land on my shirt or the table. \\n\\nMy husband and I chose ham and pineapple slices. I don't know what kind of \\\"ham\\\" this was, but it was actually soggy, with a texture like cheap, generic bologna. Terribly gross. They were also very skimpy with the cheese, so I'm not really sure how that tasted.\\n\\nAs we were finishing up, a man came in carrying a toddler and asked if he could use the restroom. Apparently they said no, because he threw a fit, and told the manager (or whoever he was) that it was pretty bad they wouldn't let a little girl use the restroom. \\n\\nVery slow service, not terribly clean, not terribly well-stocked, bad pizza, and no forks or restrooms.

The Good Egg does not at all serve *good* eggs ... they are PROCESSED!\\n\\nWhen the bill for our food arrived, the restaurant charged a dollar extra for an omelette to be prepared only with egg whites. I asked why. \\\"Because it's more expensive for us,\\\" said the server.\\n\\n\\\"How can removing the yolk be more expensive? Aren't you paying for the same egg either way?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Unless you order an actual fried egg, all of our egg dishes are prepared with a mix.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean, 'a mix?'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We buy pre-mixed eggs in a carton.\\\"\\n\\nWhat in the WORLD!? \\n\\nIt turns out that even if my aunt had ordered her omelette with the yolks (read: normally) it still would have been made from a processed egg product, manufactured in some unknown location by an unknown corporate agri-business conglomerate.\\n\\nThe menu does not disclose any of this. If it did, business would drop like a rock.\\n\\nThe manager corroborated the server, that egg-whites only actually cost their company MORE money than if they cracked open fresh eggs themselves. \\n\\nFirst, why would a company named The *Good* Egg use anything but actual and real eggs in ANY dish? (Whatever processed egg-ish product they are using certainly includes preservatives and God knows what else.) Second, if their processed egg product is indeed more costly, why is it their preference? As a business person, I will say out loud right here and now that the people in the restaurant are mistaken ... if the oh-so-important egg-ish stuff The Not-So-Good Egg pours on a fry griddle is so damned excellent then, well, the truth is that the only reason for this strictly business decision is that the product costs less, not more.\\n\\nMy family has been a customer of this chain - and this specific restaurant - for 15 years, and this not-fresh egg issue came as news to us. \\n\\nWe were not offered a discount when paying for our four meals. The server and manager both told us that next time we are in we will know to ask for our dishes to be prepared with actual eggs. There will not be a next time.\n",

They where already taking down the buffet items & it was only 11am (2nd clue). Went to the omlet bar and the cook looked grouchy and pissed to have to open back up. The sign said your choice of cheese but seems like the cook picks what type of cheese you want on your omlet. Even worse was the cold bacon, cold french toast, & yucky tasting cold dry pancakes. The self serve milk was room temperature. And to top it off they charged me 18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more. The whole tab was like $120.00 for the worst breakfast this summer. Only 2 things I liked about this restaurant, Samantha, our waitress and the fruit. Would definitaly NOT go back here.

            "Review: What I thought would have been a very nice and romantic Valentine's Day dinner at the Four Seasons resort Crescent Moon restaurant turned out to be a stunning disappointment. \\n\\nFirst of all, we were seated outside- twice. The staff member who brought us out there took us immediately back in because he thought the hostess had made a mistake. But no, the mistake was his, so back out we went. Did I mention there was a light drizzle outside? Fortunately, we were flanked by two heaters so searing I wondered if I would have to reach for the Solarcaine when I got home. \\n\\nWe got menus right away, but waited quite a while even for some water. When our waitress took our order for food, she did not even ask if we wanted drinks, even though my husband was holding the wine list open in his hands. When I asked for a gin, she did not bother to ask my husband if he cared for anything. When I got my gin, my glass was chipped. She apologized and brought me another. Unfortunately for all of us, this turned out to be only her first apology of the night.\\n\\nWe got a basket of breads which were just ok- some may have even been a bit on the tough side. Then a waiter came over and tried to give us entrees that were not ours, and we had not even had the first course of their special Valentine's Day menu. At last our sweet corn cream soup arrived, with a strip of poblano and a goat cheese empanada floating in it. Hubby liked it better than I did, but I do not care much for sweets at dinner. It was pretty good for what it was. \\n\\nOur entrees consisted of a petite filet, some king crab leg meat (out of the shell), and Yorkshire pudding with creamed spinach on top. We both ordered our beef medium rare, but what we got was overdone on one side and rare on the other. The crab was nearly inedible- it tasted like it had been previously frozen, and was totally overdone and chewy. Having just spent Christmas on the gulf coast catching and eating crab, we know what fresh tastes like and this was NOT it. When the waitress came to check on us and Hubby commented on the crab, she offered to bring us a new plate of it. We declined, not trusting they could get it right. We also had to let her know that steak knives would have been nice for our steak. The pudding and spinach were decent.\\n\\nThe dessert was the stand-out of the whole dinner: a small scoop of very dark chocolate ice cream (house made), a coconut cake (really more like a big soft cookie) topped with a layer of firm chocolate and then with a circle of flan. The presentation was nice and the small drops of super fresh caramel sauce as decor were so delicious that I would have purchased a jar to take home. Props to the pastry chef. However, I had to ask for coffee and cream, and then she did not bring sugar. How freaking specific do I have to be? It was just the tip of the iceberg in a night of thoughtless service. \\n\\nThe first reviewer commented that the \\\"service was good- but you cannot expect less-- it's the Four Seasons!\\\" I would have expected this to be true, but left completely astonished that the staff was so poorly managed or trained that we had to ask for beverages and proper utensils, that our menus were left on the table until the first course arrived, that the bread and butter were still on the table as we left, that I was served my drink in a chipped glass, and that we were seated outside when it was drizzling. Let alone the decidedly mediocre food- as DINKs, we do not mind spending $150 on a good meal. But when we left wishing we'd gone to Arriba, that's a problem. Oh- and my last impression? No soap in the ladies' room.\\n\\nUPDATE: I wrote to corporate- something I almost never do. I got a very quick response, and then a few days later another from the local food manager who offered to comp us a meal. Not being the type to complain just in order to get free stuff, I declined. I figured that if I were in charge, I sure as hell would want to know if food, service, and housekeeping were far below the standard that my \\\"brand\\\" suggested.\n",

I definitely want to experience the show from the balcony seats one day though (FYI: heard it's actually less expensive AND you get the whole view of the stage!!!).\\n\\nSeriously, do yourself the most memorable favor by treating yourself to enjoy this show. warning: it will sweep you off your feet =)\n",

The vibe is real intimate and cozy, but it's also extremely popular.  I thought going on a cold November Saturday afternoon around 4PM it would be quiet but it was jam packed and crowded.  There are 2 seaters tables and they are litteraly neck and neck together with folks.  so I strongly suggest that if you want to come here get here as early as possible.\\n\\nThere was only one waiter working the floor and this guy was just getting slammed. But he was actually really good considering how incredibly busy he was.\\n\\nPeche Mortel is probaby their most popular beer, but this is a good chance to come here and drink their one offs which aren't bottled.  The had a Disco Soleil IPA which was excellent, a bit shocking since most IPAs in Quebec I find are really lacking, and they absolutley nailed a Kolsch called Basse Messe.\\n\\nThe WiFi is also incredibly slow, but such is life.

The atmosphere is cozy, minimalist and modern, which is a nice departure from your usual Italian-immitation pizza places.  \\n\\nThe menu isn't huge but it's definitely well-rounded and offers a lot of unusual, interesting choices.  Here's what we tried:\\n\\nSpinach salad ($8.95) -- this was the perfect size for 2 people to share.  The spinach greens were fresh and came loaded with great toppings like walnuts, orange segments, garbanzo beans and salty slices of ricotta salata cheese-- an interesting and delicious combo of flavors :)\\n\\nDue Forni pizza ($15.95) -- SUPER good!! You have a choice of pizza crust style and we chose the Neapolitan, which is thin and chewy.  The crust actually reminded me of pizza I had in Italy, which is very hard to find! The toppings were fabulous too -- homemade sausage, fresh mozzarella, bacon and roasted red peppers.  FYI, the pizza was only 12-14\\\" in diameter so if you're super hungry, you should probably order your own pizza.  \\n\\nRicotta drizzled w/ Honey & Toasted Pistacios ($6.95) -- this dessert was creamy and delicious and felt decadent without being too heavy.  The ricotta was incredibly smooth, not-too-sweet and when combined with the honey and pistacios...WOW!! \\n\\nOverall I was really impressed with this place -- the food was wonderful and uses high-quality ingredients that make the dishes special & memorable.  Service was great throughout; our server was very knowledgeable, polite and attentive.

It is a little casual place for lunch and I think they have some specials but I never order them.  Don't come with a big group but its not a bad quick date place since the food is so great.\n",

It is a converted / restored train station, which is absolutely beautiful.  The vintage photos of locomotives are wonderful to see.  Nice views out onto the river as well.  2)  The staff is very friendly and accomodating.  Good service.  3)  The brunch buffet has just about everything you could possibly want, and lots of it.  The food tasted great.  4)  This place has their own donut maker!!  How cool is that?  Freshly made delicious donuts, this place deserves 6 stars.  Come here for brunch, smile all afternoon...\n",

And after we got seated everything went downhill the sodas were nasty, the waitress got my order completely wrong, they shorted the hubby on bacon and sausage I asked for a cake to go and never got that. The only thing the manager would say was I am sorry she didn't put the order in right. Although I guess it was nice that he gave us $5.00 off.  We have had good service there so I suppose it's who you get as a server.\n",

There are also a few tables in the lobby where patrons can have cocktails or order an entree from the menu....yup, they serve food and adult beverages.\\n\\nThe cinemas themselves have been revamped with wider seats and small tables in between the seats. There is waiter service to bring you food and drinks during the show along with cloth napkins and silverware. The set-up is still stadium seating and there appear to be long tables closer to the screen for larger parties as the tables further up are arranged in groups of two.\\n\\nPrices are less than I expected. Three beers and Parmesan fries was $20. This is not a bargain night out, but still an enjoyable outing and this experience may compel me to go the movies more often. May not be everyone's cup of tea but I for one enjoyed myself.\n",

Our daughter loved her pancakes but our food was so greasy. The decor in the recent is very dated and the bathrooms are scary!\\n\\nI am revamping my review after the follow up post so that the Owner can see my comments and make aware to others-the reason why we Yelp. We went to this restaurant because it was reviewed and had good reviews, we were just surprised. We did not attend yesterday, but I did write the review yesterday because I had time to write it up. We actually went 2 weeks ago on a Saturday after all of the BBQ items were off the menu because BBQ night is Friday apparently. I would NEVER hold it against anyone for the weather conditions as we had on 9/8/14. Honestly that is ridiculous. NO ONE saw that storm coming nor did they realize what was going to happen. But that was NOT when we visited this location.  When I make a comment about the renovations, it is my opinion. I was confused by the laminated discs hanging on the wall and the blue room across, that is my opinion, and I am entitled to it. Part of being on yelp is making comments about the ambience of a room-unless I have understood that wrong. I love retro and vintage but that was not what was happening at this location. \\n\\nWe will not be back. I honestly can say I did not feel that my food was \\\"fresh\\\" I had a greasy ruben that was underheated and french fries that were limp. As I stated before my daughter loved her pancake and was excited about eating it, that is why I gave 1 star. My husband had a burger and it was greasy as well and the beans he had on the side were worse than Bush's Baked Beans-or perhaps they were the same thing, he honestly could not tell and he did not finish them. \\n\\nHopefully this 2nd review clears up any issues you have with my OPINION on YELP!\n",

Are you kidding me? I have spent hundreds of dollars at this store.\\n\\nI understand the costs businesses incur when running things as debit/credit, apparently B&L doesn't understand the cost they incur when mistreating customers.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and and go to Perry's Pool and Pump.  They knowledgeable as well and will treat you with a bit more respect.  I am not willing to give my business to any store that mistreats their customers.\\n\\n*Update*\\nThe reason why debit was an issue was because it was such a small amount, not because it was a debit card.  Stores pay a transaction fee and the fee was going to essentially cancel the actual payment made.  My wife and I generally don't carry cash on us.  The money a business would lose in this situation is more than offset by the purchases of mass chlorine, acid, and salt for our pool.\\n\\n*Important Update*\\nMike from B&L contacted me to try and set things straight and get to the bottom of what happened.  That is a great indicator that they are trying to improve upon the customer service and are at least aware that in an age of social media, service needs to be top of mind for any business.  \\n\\nThat being said, I have no interest in going back.

The horchata is recommended and is included in the lunch buffet. Try it! It's sweet with a touch of cinnamon. I prefer it to horchata from some Mexican eateries in Los Angeles, even. When you're seated at a table, you're given tortilla chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas given with the chips are great. One is refried beans; another is avocado-based; the other is tomato-based. My favorite is the avocado-based salsa since it has great flavor and a little spice kick. The chicken tacos at the buffet were awesome. The lady assisting customers at the buffet was so friendly. There were only corn tortillas for tacos, but you can order flour tortillas at your table. I also really enjoyed the rice. It was flavorful without being too salty. The chicken chimichanga is nothing to rave about but still pretty good. For dessert, my party of 4 had split a banana foster. It was a bit too runny for my taste. I'm used to a more syrup-like consistency. Overall, I liked this place and would recommend to others.

It has a nice variety of Asian products ranging from Chinese to Filipino and everything in between, which is nice since we won't have to go to multiple locations. We used to go to 99 Ranch but ever since we moved farther out west, this place is very convenient. \\n\\nI love going from aisle to aisle just to discover new items to try. From hair products to junk food, even new tea to drink. When I was making pho from scratch, I was able to buy every detailed ingredients in one place. They are complete with lots of herbs and spices, sauces, powders, you name it! Their facility is also very clean. If you end up having a language problem with an employee, it won't be hard to find someone who can speak English. I'm pretty sure majority of them can speak English anyway. \\n\\nAnd I love their bakery/deli selections. I buy the pastries to bring for lunch, and I like to order their dim sum whenever I'm craving them but wouldn't want to go to Orchid's Garden or Chang's by myself. Their deli items are pretty good for the price. Instead of going to Panda Express, I'd advice you to go here instead.

Food is really heavy, rich, and greasy-almost like fast food type and for what you get, it's pretty expensive. Wait is long and service is not that great, and even then youll probably end up being seated outside in the cold.\\n\\n For starters, my friends and i ordered the onion ring tower. It comes out stacked beautifully with dipping sauces of ranch and such, and was actually pretty good-probably the best part of the entire meal. For my main entree I ordered the truffle mac and cheese ($14). The dish was decent, but nothing too memorable, just a bunch of cheese mixed into some pasta, which I couldn't even finish because it was just too rich after a couple of bites. High heel pump sandwich ($16) is HUGE, but it's also a got so much going on in it it that it becomes a big sloppy mess to eat. My friend ordered the ABC burger which she said was good, but nothing great that would make her come back for it again, especially for $16.50. Maybe this place is better left for desserts. I've heard good things about their frozen hot chocolate selections so next time I'm here, Ill definitely try that instead.\n",

I always order the waffle and it normally comes out cold and is served with cold syrup but Mary's cheerful personality kept me coming back anyways. This last time, Sunday, November 16, 2014, we sat at the counter and seemed like an inconvenience to our waitress the entire breakfast. There is nothing worse than feeling like you are not worthy of someone's time. I understand that turning over tables is important but it's also important to ensure your guests are satisfied. Couldn't get our waters refilled quickly, food came out cold, waitress was impersonal and the cashier was awfully rude as well. I'd recommend sunrise cafe or protein house instead.\n",

            "Review: We decided to go to the Linq, walk around and celebrate St. Patrick's Day there. Chayo seemed appealing with their decoration so we decided to sit and eat lunch there.\\n\\nOur experience was absolutely horrible. The restaurant wasn't as packed as we anticipated (for being St. Patty's day). When we sat, we waited a bit to be served. We placed our drinks order. We waited like 20 min for them to be delivered. We finally placed our food order and it took forever to arrive as well. We ordered chicken, fried fish, and lobster tacos to start and they were all pretty bland and simple. Definitely not worth the price. When we got our tacos, we ordered some hot sauce to make them a little tasty. They took so long to bring the hot sauce that we finished every single one of our tacos!! When someone finally brought the hot sauce, they just dropped it off quickly and they even forgot to take the wrapper off! So WE had to do that. Thanks! Great service! \\n\\nWe constantly had empty plates on our table. The busser would take so long to clear our table that we had glasses of beer stacked on top of each other. \\n\\nEvery time that we would order a beer, it would literally take 20 min to get it. So be aware of this! \\n\\nWhen we finished eating the tacos (starters) the busser was already setting the table for dessert when we didn't even order our main course. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas as a main course and they were extremely greasy. Wish we had just gone straight to dessert instead. \\n\\nIt really was a horrible service even though 70% of the tables in the restaurant were empty. I wouldn't go back to this place at all!\n",

I've tried a good amount of different types of baked goods, and I'm let down every time. The breads just don't taste good. Some are too dry, some too bland, etc. This may be because I'm from Los Angeles where there are hundreds of franchise korean bakeries that know what they're doing. This may also contribute to my opinion on the appearance of the goods. The packaging on some of the goods are just not professional - scotch tape all around the packaging? really? Also, the coffee bun just looks like they've tried to copy something and just hasn't worked out. \\n\\nThe pizza bread is fine - can't go wrong with that.\\nBreads with beans inside  are fine too.\\n\\nOverall, the goods look and taste like an amateur baker tried to make some goods at home.\\n\\nOnto the service... the older lady I've seen there a couple times seems to treat me depending on her mood. This may be because I'm younger. A few times I would go, and she wouldn't say a word to me, ring me up, mumble the total, and give me the change. I said thank you in korean. No response. Recently, I went, and there was a good amount of people browsing around. She was a little more friendly.\n",

They ran out of fries after taking our order that we were picking up without telling us.  That would have been nice to know before we picked up our order.  And then, they also go the order wrong.\\n\\nAnother time we ordered two orders of fries, one order had a lot of fries and the other had half of it, yet we were charged the same price for both.  We also ordered onion rings and I think that only 1/2 the container was filled, which onion rings are not very compact.\\n\\nThey would not honor a coupon from their own site.  What gives.  Tonight we ordered 3 subs and the subs were mediocre and had less meatballs than they had normally.  When I inquired why our order was so expensive, they said the price of their subs went up last week.  So, from earlier this spring the meatball subs were $5 and now $7?  Ridiculous price increase.\\n\\nMaybe the pizza is cheap, but I think we'll see if we can find another place nearby maybe towards Safeway area that is comparable.

The eastern location was the fanciest one! The building structure was ridiculous (the good kind). Than that leaves the Sahara location.

            "Review: I've visited this establishment twice, once for dinner and more recently for their reopened lunch buffet. For dinner, the food was okay, but the service was severely lacking. It took forever (about 2 hours total) to order our food, get water and refills, get our food and finally pay our check. The butter chicken was so-so. The aloo gobi even less remarkable. The 2 kinds of naan were too doughy. Despite this mediocre experience, I was willing to give their lunch buffet a try, especially since the wifey was curious to experience their cuisine. What a mistake that was... First of all, the price of $11.99 is at the high end for Indian lunch buffets, and this place is the exception to the rule that you get what you pay for. The selection and quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing. Ok, to be fair, it was still better than our abysmal experience at Sherpa House (in Golden, CO) but that is setting the bar extremely low. There were a whopping total of 8 hot trays consisting of items such as onion \\\"pakora\\\" (basically onion ring fragments), orange chicken, daal, chana masala, goan fish curry, lamb curry, paneer masala, and (non-Basmati) rice. There was also a small salad bar section and kheer. There was a surprising lack of classic staples such as mango chutney, samosas, Tandoori chicken, any kind of chicken curry, or saag. Although we enjoyed the fish curry, it could not make up for the lack of selection and quality of the rest of items. The garlic naan was so-so. It was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and dry on the bottom. The kheer was the worst we've ever had. It lacked cardamom flavor and contained numerous clumps of rice. At least this time around, the service was half decent. The only other mitigating factor was they were running a $2 off promotion, although we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied. That being said, the fact that this place garners stellar reviews is a real head scratcher. Perhaps, restaurants located in the (relative) boonies are held to a lower standard. Who knows? As for me, when I rate a restaurant, I don't care where a restaurant is located. The food is either good or it isn't. It's either a good value or it isn't. Unfortunately, this place is neither.\n",

The food is horrible. I've had 1/2 the items on the menu looking for something good, and there's nothing that brings me back, and what's worse, most of it needs to be avoided. They tout their burgers, and then ask you how you want it cooked, which is really funny since they cook EVERYTHING well done, no matter what you ask for. I don't mind places that cook to one temperature, but don't ask me how I want it cooked if you're not going to cook it that way. Two of the three times I had a burger I was with a friend that got one as well. I order Med-Rare, he gets Med-Well and they both come out the exact same. \\n\\nThe place used to have the coldest beer in the area, but even that's gone. Went there the other night because I only had 30 minutes to kill and didn't want to drive a little further to my favorite bar. I just wanted to watch the baseball game, but they wanted a cover charge because some UFC fight was on.\\n\\nThe waitress can be cute, but the service is poor unless you're at the bar. They have one bar tender (not sure his name, has a shaved heard) that has great service, but that's it since Megan is gone. \\n\\nIt's not bad enough where'd I say avoid because their happy hour prices aren't bad for drinks, but we only go there when there's no time to go anywhere else.\n",

During that time, the front desk lost his reservation and apparently was very unhelpful with finding him another spot to stay...leaving him stranded to fend for himself on his first night in Vegas.\\n\\nWe got a late flight so checked in at 11:30pm (after an hour long wait).  the room we requested was unavailable, even though we called ahead of time to make sure they still had our reservation and our room.  They preceded to check us into a temporary room with a room change to be made the next morning.  Renee on the front desk was a sweetheart and the only person in the hotel who really seemed to care.  We preceded up to our room and all of a sudden I started coughing and sneezing and was having a severe allergic reaction.  My friend went out in the hallway to get ice and noticed we were in one of the only \\\"Pet Friendly\\\" rooms in the hotel.  I have severe allergies to pets and no one informed us that it was a pet room.  We called down and were placed on hold for 15 mins when we decided to not waste our first night there and hung up to head downstairs to the casino.  We came back to our room at an obscene hour only to find ourselves locked out of our room.  I guess the reasoning was that they changed our room and keys but neglected to tell us this.\\n\\nThe next morning we phoned front desk to see if our room was ready.  They gave us a timeline of 1pm but when we went to get our new room keys,  the room was still not ready.  Were were given a fantastic room on the 20th floor with a strip view, which is what we wanted in the first place. The only plus of this whole experience.\\n\\nWhen we checked out we had a charge of 160$ in internet...OUT OF THIS WORLD.  when we explained to them how disappointed we were, and how the internet barely worked, the front desk (including supervisor) refused to do anything about it.  They also blamed us for not reading the terms and conditions or telling them about my allergy.  Internet is charged per person per location, so 3 charges were from our initial room., and another 3 from the new room..in the same day.  We had to ask for the number to the internet company and call from our Canadian cell phones because apparently all the phones in the Flamingo are for in house, which I know is a complete lie.  I work in a hotel and this is by far the WORST customer service I've ever received. If the Flamingo is supposed to be this wonderful \\\"centre of the strip, historic, Vegas resort\\\", the staff should stand beside it. We never heard an apology out of anyone.  The internet company ended up taking off the charges for us, and could not believe that the front desk did nothing about it.\\n\\nI will NOT stay here again, even though the casino, restaurants and rooms were great for the price.  Customer service is #1 and I was overly disappointed with the service received.\n",

            "Review: I admit to being a victim of the Groupon scam!  I can only imagine how many times this office has succeeded in duping customers since my experience with them was exactly the same as others I've read online.  The hygienist will recommend the so-called deep cleaning.  You will be given an estimate of what they would charge you, but since you don't have insurance, you'll get a discounted price.  If you balk at this newly discounted price and threaten to leave, you will be given another discount.  But wait, there's more.  When you go ahead with the procedure, because, golly, it would go against their standards to do the regular cleaning you've bought and paid for, you will get ANOTHER price when it's time to pay!  Please check this price as it will include, \\\"hygienist Instruction\\\", which is the for the time and effort she spent talking you into the outrageously expensive deep cleaning.  I'm guessing this $59 is her bonus as it was taken off my bill when I asked what exactly did \\\"hygienist instruction\\\" entail.  (the answer was, \\\"I guess it was her instruction to you\\\")\\nI hope to save others the bother of trying to use this Groupon or any other deal this office issues.  They want you in the chair to sell you unnecessary services at an inflated rate.  (I say unnecessary because I used this Groupon offer to check out a new dental office.  I have a regular dentist to whom I will be returning, who never proposed the amount of work this office proposed!)\n",

            "Review: The Cosmopolitan's  \\\"grand social experiment\\\".  It delivers!\\n\\nWalk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.\\n\\nEssentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.\\n\\nBreaking it down:\\n\\nCraft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).\\n\\nStage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  \\n\\nClub - Still need to experience this.\\n\\nRestaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter saut\\u00e9ed spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).\\n\\nFor larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.\\n\\nIncredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).\\n\\nOutstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.\\n\\nTip;  To make the most of your experience:\\n1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.\\n2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.\\n3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.\\n4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.\\n5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.\\n6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.\\n\\nNow if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.\n",

            "Review: Back in its heyday in the 1990s, Bagels Etc was a fantastic place.  Cheap, friendly, great food. Throw in the occasional Leonard Cohen sighting and it was my go to breakfast and brunch joint. \\n\\nSo, yeah, this place has been living on its reputation for quite some time. And the prices have gone up, the food has gone downhill, Lenny's out on tour, and the service.... well, the service is something truly special. My only guess is that it's been under new management for a while.  The service is truly atrocious and unpleasant.  Memories be damned: the last time I went is the last time I will go. \\n\\nThe wait was forever and there were empty tables everywhere. The servers didn't even bother looking up from their conversation to help us. We had to track down the manager to complain. And he didn't care. And - as already observed - the service makes inappropriate and offensive comments.  One a previous trip (my second to last), the server made some offhand joke about Parkinson's disease (she was jittery when bringing our coffee) when my friend at the table's father is suffering from that horrible disease. They are rude, inefficient and just plain awful. I guess if you like that kind of \\\"experience\\\", Bagels Etc is the place for you. For everyone else, go elsewhere.\n",

Working from home, I need to get out and set up shop elsewhere every once in a while so that I don't start talking to my houseplants, and more often than not, Lux is my destination.\\n\\nThe service at Lux is always friendly and often funny. And I've sat close enough to the register enough times to hear them being friendly to people of all ages, shapes and sizes. The coffee is rich, dark and delicious. I usually stick with a house coffee with soy milk, so I do ok price-wise. I even buy the whole beans to brew my own coffee at home. I like it that much.\\n\\nLux gets packed, but I've always been able to find a space and get access to an outlet for my power sucking laptop (not an apple, by the by). The music is good and mellow--think the Shins or the Stones. They've also got killer pastries, and if you time it right, you'll get them fresh out da oven.\\n\\nCoffee shops are all kind of a personal preference thing.

Virtually every encounter with staff just fell short with a lack of hospitality, strange since they're in the hospitality business!    Checked in around midnight and was impressed with the room size and decor.  Went to the casino to have a drink and gamble some.  Bottle of Bud at the bar for $5.50 seems steep so went to gamble. Was playing for awhile when the waitress came by calling for drinks, ordered another Beer and leaving a tip when she said $5.50.....when did they start charging for drinks when you're already down $100!!!!  Dealers were no conversationalists and the 3 that worked our table seamed to be in training mode.  Called it a night and at 8am the maids r knocking on the door.  What's so hard to flag a room that doesn't check in till midnight to and only booked a one night stay to come clean at noon!!  Guess that first get the &:)?& outta here didn't work as an hour later they're knocking again.  Lost that battle so got in the shower to find a big wad of hair in the drain....and it wasn't me pulling out mine.....disgusting! My wife grabbed the camera and we were ready to take action. Went to check out desk,asked first about policy of waking guests so early and were told \\\"you should hang the tag out before you go to bed\\\"...okay showed the receptionist the hair drain picture, she apologized reluctantly and said she would make note of it. We then asked to speak with manger on duty who came up front to help us. Same sad so sorry lame apology and indicated she could do no service recovery or price adjustment because we booked thru expedia. My wife then continued to give her an opportunity to make it right, but silence.Finally we said how about breakfast accommodation as we are now up early and hungry.She thought that was a good idea but did want us to know there was a cap on that of $25.oo...gave in but grudgingly...whew,lotta work,won't be back...\n",

It was super crowded, and the crowd... well... it wasn't what I was expecting, let's just leave it at that. However, that is no fault of Daylight. \\n\\nEntering the pool/dayclub was just a mess. People everywhere, no sense of organization, no one paying attention to anything. Our friends were already inside at a daybed, so we were meeting them. We finally got the attention of the right person and got inside. What a zoo!! Eventually, I found out that the crowd demographics were because Kendrick Lamar was performing. Ok, that makes sense.\\n\\nDuring the course of the day, I witnessed at least 3 major fist-fights. Security usually came promptly to break it up- with the use of more violence. The drinks were expectedly expensive, and service was sparse.\\n\\nI will say that the DJ was great, and the sound system was really good as well. The size of the pool looked pretty big as well, but of course, it was overflowing with people. \\n\\nI'd probably give it another try on a non-holiday weekend to see if things are any different.\n",

The charcoal grilled hot dogs always tasted sooo good.  \\n\\nIn high school, I discovered that Ted's had a location in Tempe, only a bit away from my parent's house in Mesa.  The yumminess of the food definitely translated west of the Mississippi.  Everything is so good and has that awesome taste of being grilled and perhaps fried (like the fries and onion rings)  without being too heavy.\\n\\nI love standing in line, calling out my order when asked, buying Weber's mustard (I haven't found it sold anywhere else in Arizona), drinking fountain rootbeer that has a kick, looking at the Buffalo, NY paraphenalia that decorates the walls. \\n\\nOn the trays, there is a paper with a quiz that I pretty much have memorized.  I know, from the quiz, that Ted's uses 7 million pickle spears per year.  I also always laugh with my friends over the easiest question on the quiz: \\\"True or False; there is a Ted's Hotdogs location in Tempe, AZ\\\" (the quiz was clearly written for my Ted's friends to the east).\\n\\nIt gets pretty crowded at lunchtime and stays that way through the afternoon.

            "Review: Since moving from Hawaii back in 1995 to Arizona, I've been very skeptical about places that claim to serve \\\"Hawaiian\\\" food here, because as we all know, pineapple on a pizza does NOT make it Hawaiian. I know what Hawaiian-esque food is supposed to taste like. \\n\\nRight away I wasn't impressed because we weren't greeted by the customary Aloha that the person behind the counter is supposed to do to everyone entering the restaurant.  Some people were but not us. The place had the look and feel of a fast food restaurant. Dah that's because it was. The d\\u00e9cor was made up of posters of Hawaii, Hawaiian Aloha shirts and a single surfboard on the walls. Not very impressive nor did it give you the feel of a restaurant in Hawaii. \\n\\nAnyway to the food. My wife ordered the Kalua Pork - Smoke-flavored, shredded pork with white rice mixed with cabbage. She immediately said it didn't taste anything like the pork we've had in Hawaii. It had no flavor so she added some  katsu sauce to it. That made it edible. She didn't even eat the rice or cabbage. I think she only ate the pork because she was hungry.   \\n\\nI ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 plate of chicken, & short ribs. It came with white rice, cabbage and macaroni salad. But the  macaroni salad was not cold because they placed the chicken which was hot on top of the macaroni salad so it was warm. The short ribs were NOTHING like I had when I lived in Hawaii. In addition to them not being \\\"authentic\\\" I've had better at local Asian restaurants or buffets. I have to admit the chicken wasn't that bad but again it wasn't \\\"authentic\\\" Hawaiian short ribs either. I dipped it in their teriyaki sauce which made it better. The short ribs on the other hand was so bad I didn't eat them. They were tasteless  and Hawaiian short ribs are normally amazing.  \\n\\nI guess this is what happens when you try and eat Hawaiian food in a city like Phoenix that's the furthest you can possible get from Hawaii. I'll never come back here because of their false advertising and horrible food. Please change your name L&L Hawaiian BBQ, because this place is not Hawaiian.\\n\\nFOOD: Maybe the original L & L in Hawaii is good but this L&L franchise location was truly  disappointing. The food was SUB-PAR  If I would have been satisfied with my meal maybe I wouldn't be judging this place so harshly. I was so disappointed that the food didn't live up to what the promises in its name. SERVICE:  The gal behind the counter represented everything but the spirit of Aloha was about. She had a look one her that said she wasn't very happy and didn't want to be there. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is high. AMBIANCE:The d\\u00e9cor was made up of posters of Hawaii, Hawaiian Aloha shirts and a single surfboard on the walls. Not very impressive nor did it give you the feel of a restaurant in Hawaii. CONCLUSION: There's not really much to say here..I miss Hawaii... but what i miss more is the FOOD!  I spotted this place while visiting Applebee's and thought... OH MAN - THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING!  then I tried it. RETURN FACTOR 0%. \\n  \\n    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************\\n\\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \\n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \\n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \\n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \\n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business.

            "Review: Short version: This place is a shithole. Don't bother.\\nLong version: From the moment we walked into the rental office to the day we moved out, this place was a stain.  My husband and I chose Talus as temporary living quarters based on proximity while awaiting the completion of our new home.  In retrospect, it was an impetuous and ill-informed decision.  I suppose our short-term status blinded us, but if you're on the lookout for long-term housing be warned.\\nWe had issues with:\\n*  Parking spaces -  We were told it would be two weeks before one was available.  Fine, except in reality there wasn't one available for the better part of TWO MONTHS. \\n*  Structure - It was so fucking loud in that place that we never once slept through the night while we lived here.  Never.  I know apartments have a reputation for paper-thin walls, but trust me, this isn't the first \\\"multi-family\\\" housing situation I've lived in, and the light fixtures literally swayed from the tenants above simply walking around.  I'm not exaggerating.  I won't even get in to the frequent toddler wrestling matches that took place above us.  \\n*  Staff - outside of the initial contract negotiations, nobody here gives a tin shit about the tenants.  Our infrequent complaints were always met with a scowl and were typically pawned off onto another party, if addressed at all. No complaint or conflict was ever sufficiently handled.  \\n*  Grounds - every conceivable surface was covered in dog shit. Constantly.  The pool was consistently green and littered with cigarette butts and spent beer cans.\\n*  Bugs -  Out of control. I've lived in Phoenix for nearly 20 years and have never experienced this many scorpions, ants or crickets.  I'll echo Chrysty C.'s previous complaint that charging for \\\"monthly\\\" pest control ought to negate any pest sightings.  It didn't.  We found several scorpions and countless crickets. We also spent many a night vacuuming ants from our bathroom and bedroom floors.  While the pests mainly infested the interior, the worst area was the water heater closet on the patio - the crickets were so numerous that we began referring to the closet as the \\\"Temple of Doom\\\".  Foul.  \\nIt's difficult to pinpoint which aspect was the worst.  Pure suffering for three months.\\nI feel it's important to point out that it's been two years since we lived here (June - September, 2008).  Maybe the situation has improved since we left.  Somehow I doubt it.   Regardless, I'm still upset about our time here, and I thought my fellow Yelpers should know.   Caveat emptor!\n",

While it doesn't spin like one of the legends may lead you to believe, the head is back after an apparent hiatus. i assume it returned to its alien planet to report all the boring observations made inside of the random business park where he resides.

They use the shoestring fries but there was one wedge cut fry in there too and it was very tasty! My only complaint was they had onions on top and I didn't know that when ordering, so we had to scoop them off. We had the same server as last time and he did a great job, with the exception of our waters going dry during dessert. We got the Pizookie trio with pumpkin, cookies & cream, and chocolate chunk!

Gated Security was very professional. They ask for your name in which you made the reservation, checks the list, then gives you a parking pass.\\nValet was very professional and efficient. Unlimited Valet during the entire stay which is also included in the Resort Fee.\\nCheck-In was smooth however, we booked thru Jet Luxury Resort, so we could not actually Check-In until 3pm. So we had to wait about 20 minutes.\\nRoom was gorgeous. Our room was on the 32nd floor. 32-621 to be exact which is a large corner suite. Balcony view is awesome. Nice size bathrooms. Double sinks which is very necessary for me and my boo. Bed was very plush with the goose down pillows and comforter. Full kitchen with the top of the line Sub Zero fridge, dishwasher, microwave, Hamilton Beach blender, toaster, all the dishes, pots & pans, silverware and glassware that you would have at home. Very comfy!\\nMaid service was very efficient. We had our Do Not Disturb light on the entire time we were there so housekeeping left a bag with fresh towels and water bottles everyday. Nice Touch! We had more than enough towels to use. When that red DND light is on, you will not be disturbed PERIOD! \\nThere is an actual doorbell for the suite too so if you are expecting a delivery or maintenance they already know to ring the bell.\\nWe had full access to ALL the pools at the MGM including the Lazy River. The drinks are very over priced. $8.65 for a Heineken... Let's just say $10. Are we really keeping the change. Going to the pool was very relaxin. More than enough space to find your own little section and lay out!\\nCONS:\\nThere were no Robes or Slippers in the closet waiting for us. I was looking forward to putting mine on. I called Jet Luxury and the girl said we only get robes if we are the Owners. Later when I had the fallout with Mandy the \\\"Operatilns Manager\\\", I brought up the fact that we didn't have robes in the room. She said that they were available upon request... And we Still Never Got the Robes!\\nThere was an iHome in the room however it did not work that great! It had lots of static... Connector was damaged I believe.\\nThe Flat Screen TV in the bedroom did not pop up out of the desk. I guess the hydraulic lift was broken so we had to call maintenance. Took them about 20 minutes to arrive.\\nThe TV in the bathroom was completely broken. I would not even cut on. Called Jet Luxury to repair. My Boo wanted to watch the Football game while taking a shower. An hour passed by and still no maintenance. They said they would send someone right up. Never Happened! I then called Jet Luxury to speak to a manager. Ended up talking to the \\\"Operations Manager\\\" by the name of Mandy. She was very unprofessional. For some reason she didn't understand why we would be upset. I feel like for the money that was spent in the room, there shouldn't be anything wrong with the TV's. Besides who wants to spend their time in Vegas waiting on the Repair Guy? I'm not at home, I'm in VEGAS!\\nOverall the experience was Great! Jet Luxury has very questionable Customer Service, even though their prices are very good. Will probably book directly thru MGM next time.\n",

Lord knows what any of them would think if they went back for an espresso or latte now. \\n\\nAside from the terrible service and permanently stressed looking staff, the place is so darn busy it's difficult to get a table. Spring to summer especially, the cafe is jam-packed with tourists desperate to secure a seat with views of the Castle. To make it worse, there's merchandise everywhere you look, the music is insipid and there's a live webcam opening til closing time so strangers across the world can watch as you eat your lunch! \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment however, has to be the food and drink. On paper, soup, panninis, pitta, quiche and baked potatoes sounds quite promising but I suspect from tasting the last two that everything is part cooked in advance then microwaved. The coffee I ordered was equally bland and frothy. \\n\\nFree Wi-Fi or not, The Elephant House are going to have to raise their game if they want to inspire a new generation of writers!\n",

Each crepe was the perfect spongy, chewy consistency, and cooked *just* right.  And while you can't really mess up a Crepes Suzette or just simple strawberries and whipped cream, the Trois Fromage definitely stole the show.  It had chevre, mozzarella, and swiss, with bacon and potatoes inside as well.  We would have kept ordering different crepes off the menu if we weren't so stuffed!\\n\\nThe staff was very nice, and the location was great - just a short walk from the Metro and then to Old Montreal.  If you are in Old Montreal, forget the tourist traps they call restaurants there, and take the short walk to this place.

            "Review: I have lived at Desert Club apartments now for four months and feel I've had enough time to give my opinion on the place... \\n\\nThe Good: Convenient location to everything in Scottsdale and highway access, gated community, the pool is never too busy and great for relaxing with nice chairs, very quiet community and I hear no noise inside my apartment (top floor though), feels safe, nicer finishes in kitchen with the tile floor and granite counter tops, quick maintenance response times, ample visitor parking in rear of complex, nice gym, staff is usually friendly and helpful. Unique floor plans with lots of cabinet space in the A2 floor plan. \\n\\nThe Bad: Single entrance into complex can be annoying, grassy area's in between buildings smell like urine from all the pets, pool could use a cleaning more often (leaves and debris at the bottom) and there is constantly yellow caution tape around the hot tub (not sure what's that about), almost non-existent resident functions, efficiency of the AC in my 3rd story unit seems poor (the AC is always running), glass block window in A2 floor plan lets in a lot of heat (my apartment faces East and West), breezeways and stairs are sometimes littered and are dirty with accidents from pets. The kitchen has a spray/stream faucet which comes in handy a lot but there is no option to add a water filter. The water here isn't too great so I've had to resort to buying bottled water.\\n\\nTips: Before moving in, make sure you get the code to the entrance gate if you are moving in early in the morning or on a weekend. We didn't have the gate code for the moving company and it caused a bit of nightmare. Also, for efficiency sake, I'd request a North or South facing apartment.  \\n\\nSummary: I looked at a LOT of places in Scottsdale for an apartment before settling at Desert Club and I would probably do it all over again if I had to. The minor items on the bad list, though there are several, aren't enough to outweigh the good of the place for me so I generally enjoy living here.  I almost chose Barossa across the street but opted for Desert Club because of the larger pool and the additional square footage in the one bedroom.\n",

Wine and cocktails are great too.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, try their Hawaiian poke stack, grilled jerk wings, Buffalo wings, pastrami sliders, Ahi sliders...\\n\\nYour main meal, you have to try (and share) their Mac + cheese which has a chicken breast, apple wood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses with pasta and white truffle oil.

Came here Valentines day night and it was crowded, I had a seat while my date stood until a seat became available, the 2 bartenders working were busy but still took time to talk about their drinks and recommendations.  I ordered a drink in a souvenir cup, I don't remember what it was but the bartender asked what flavors I liked, after she shined the flashlight on the sample cups on the shelf I chose the Wild Watusi cup, and she recommended something with passion fruit/guava flavors in it.  These drinks could get dangerous, even though it tasted like a tropical fruit punch it wasn't super sweet and/or syrupy tasting, it was a great combination of flavors and liquor!  After I finished my drink they rinsed out my tiki cup and swizzle stick and boxed it back up.  I want to go back and collect them all...Pokemon style!!\n",

            "Review: The husband and I came here after work because I was starving.  Upon walking in, I was really excited and I felt like this was going to be a 5 star place.  The decor was simple and clean, and it kind of reminded me of my house.  Then it became a 4 star place when our order came to 23 dollars.  A little pricey for me.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that touted applewood smokey bacon along with a side of tater tots.  Yum!\\n\\nOur food arrived, and well, I subtracted another star because it was sloppy looking and frankly, a tad unappetizing.  My tots were pretty dark but I happen to like mine overcooked so they are really crispy.  Other people may be very disappointed with this.  The burger was very large, but the patty was very commercial.  My bacon was the biggest disappointment.  It was translucent!  I expected nice thick cut bacon when ordering an expensive burger.  The taste was no better than appearance.  It was incredibly grease laden, so much so that it made the bun soggy.  Additionally, I am 99.4% sure that everything they used comes from Costco.  The patties were definitely the same ones that come in a big stack with sheets of paper between them.  The bacon was definitely the kind that comes in the big giant reseable Kirkland bag.  Yikes.  Not good.  We're down to two stars.\\n\\nAfter I didn't finish eating my burger, I felt pretty gross.  It took a few minutes to sink in, but I realized I just put an immense amount of grease into my tummy.  I am not one to shy away from greasy diner breakfasts and the like, but holy crap, this was a new level.  I didn't feel well.  An hour later, I am definitely sick  Now we are down to one star.  I have a wicked stomach ache as I write this review.  Ugh.  I want to vomit so I can just get this crap out and pretend it never happened.  What a disappointment.\n",

            "Review: Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted. \\nI waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense. \\nI finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold. \\nThe seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was. \\nI was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar.\n",

First time was less than favorable, but I wanted to give them 1 more chance to shine... \\n\\nOn Sunday, 1/27/12 at approx 10am, that didn't happen unfortunately.\\n\\nOkay, it all starts w/the interaction at the speaker when one orders their goodies, right?

Please don't be sarcastic/snarky to me if I ask a simple question about hours of breakfast.\\n\\nSecond point of interaction - at first window.

Very unprofessional.\\n\\nThird point of interaction - delivery of food/drink. This went okay, but I ordered a vanilla iced coffee. What I rec'd was vanilla-flavored milk sans any coffee. Not cool.\\n\\nHad to park my car, go inside and explain situation to cashier. Maybe I was extra annoyed because I was a tad hungover and really needed that caffeine boost?

            "Review: We signed up for this service at the recommendation of my neighbor who has also been using it for a while.  Signed up for the $40 box every other week.  They send you an e mail prior to the delivery to let you know what would be in your box and you have the option of substituting an item for another, for example if you don't want red kale you can get more broccoli.  They deliver it to your door and if you're not home leave a cooler outside.\\n\\nWe went through a few deliveries where we found that our neighbor who was getting the $30 box was getting the exact same amount of stuff than we were getting.  An oversight by the company and it was rectified, credits were issued. During the time we communicated to them via email we have gotten many out of office replies and explanations of \\\"system issues\\\" which was the cause for some of the confusion about what we were supposed to receive.  We received blueberries with mold on them, it was corrected by giving us more red kale on the next order, not an even swap IMO.  The last box we received our neighbor who, again, receives the same box we get (we switched to the $30 box) had these HUGE bananas and much better quality produce than us.  I guess the secret to this service is to make sure you're not comparing your order to others near you\\n\\nHere's the deal.  This service is great, in principle.  Organic produce delivered right to your door, family owned business etc....but for what you're paying vs. what you get elsewhere.....you can gain a better value going to Trader Joes and picking out what you really want vs. what this service decides to give you.    In this day and age, it is essential for any business to be \\\"easy to do business with\\\".  IMO everytime we had to touch this company or they had to touch us there was an issue.\n",

I spotted this little store as we whizzed past W. Flamingo Road and suggested, \\\"Make a right turn!\\\" to my bf.  As we drove up, we noted the \\\"Closed\\\" sign and knew a return visit was a must.  \\n\\nComing up with some cute names as \\\"Road to Hana\\\" and \\\"Strawberry Fields Way\\\", Cupcake Lane Bakery tantalizes your taste buds with their large selection of tasty morsels.  After reading through each and every description, my friend chose the \\\"Michigan Avenue\\\", the bf chose the \\\"Lake Tahoe Boulevard\\\" in honor of his hometown, and I went for the \\\"Hollywood Boulevard.\\\"  (I technically should have gone for the \\\"Lombard Street\\\" or the \\\"Ghiradelli Square\\\" in tribute to my hometown!)\\n\\nThe \\\"Michigan Avenue\\\" is a \\\"lemon-infused cupcake topped with a zesty lemon cream cheese frosting and garnished with yellow and blue sprinkles.\\\"  My friend was impressed and knew she was in big trouble since this location was not too far from where she lived.  Not being a huge lemon fan myself, I was hesitant.  It was rather refreshing and light.  Sweet without being tart, and actually, pretty darn good.\\n\\nThe \\\"Lake Tahoe Boulevard\\\" is described as \\\"Sitting around the campfire and enjoying our take on the S'more.  A chocolate cupcake with a marshmallow center, topped with chocolate ganache and crushed graham crackers and finished with a drizzle of chocolate.\\\"  It tasted like a brownie with a gooey center.  It was yummy, but not that special in my opinion.\\n\\nSticking with the basics, the \\\"Hollywood Boulevard\\\" is \\\"a vanilla cupcake topped with vanilla buttercream and sprinkled with stars.\\\"  I felt this was the best way to truly taste the cupcake and the cream on its own.  The cupcake was moist, flavorful, and could stand alone.  The buttercream was sweet, not overly done, and not dependent on the cupcake to stand. I was impressed.  \\n\\nCupcake Lane Bakery has a lot of promise.  The interior decor could use some help and they have two solo couches and two small chairs for sitting.  They also offer monthly special cupcakes, like this month's was the \\\"Times Square\\\" which had champagne in it.  At $2.25/each, or $23/dozen, they are definitely going to be fair competition.  I'll be back to try the \\\"Savannah Street\\\" and the \\\"Park Avenue.\\\"\\n\\nSidenote: They even offer a Pupcake, a cupcake made specifically for your furry four-legged friend!\n",

            "Review: Let me preface this by saying it's not a terrible show, and would be great for taking an entire family to (if you can afford it). It's like many things in Vegas, and is way overpriced for what it is.\\n\\nFirst, some of the acrobatics were great, of course, but nothing I haven't seen at significantly cheaper carnivals and other shows. Sure, they had lots of energy, and I know it's a lot of work, but there wasn't a whole lot of actual talent, which is what I expected to see; this is Vegas, this is supposed to be top-shelf talent, and you can't even get some peopel who can actually shoot a bow and arrow?\\n\\nIt's a very 'busy' show, so I think for many that's all it needs to be in order to be entertained, but if you focused on the individuals, most weren't really doing much. Wow, you can play catch (and drop it a few times), not very impressive. \\n\\nThe story was kinda hacky, and the performers themselves aren't mic'd so its like watching a TV show in the Sims 3: cheezy, pointless, and lots of gibberish. The fat lady was completely unnecessary; we get it, fat people are helpless and should be laughed at, but come on, it's an ongoing joke throughout the entire show.\\n\\nAs for the show's storyline, it basically involved the fat lady matriach of a clan, two men-women (women dressed as men) fall in love to quell the spat between two lands, and pirate dudes crash the party and capture one of the man-woman. King of the pirates wants his daughter to marry, then the Fu-manchu dude presents his emo son to said daughter. Emo dude's special talents include whipping his hair back and amateur pyrotechnics, emo dude then gives the daughter a baton they pretend is a flute for some reason. Some bullshit goes on with some of the original tribes being lost, pointlessly annoying giant bugs and crabs pop up on the beach and take up 20 minutes of time for some stupid reason. Pirate king's daughter falls in love with the man-woman, and gives him the flute-baton for some reason. He plays it for a minute. She then does a baton routine with said flute (which was pretty decent actually). Eventually, the two men-women are reunited, fu manchu dude had a plan to take over all the tribes, some 'war' footage is displayed in terrible quality, then they do a happy dance. Oh, then they'll do real fireworks, which sounds cool, but super bright white light in a pitch-black theatre does what? Oh yeah, it freaking blinds you, so you can't even see it. So f*cking stupid.\\n\\nAs for the actual good parts in the show, the platform was pretty awesome and took some creative engineering. There were hints of actual talent with the baton routine, the hamster cages (you'll see), and the sparkling dude on the corde lisse, and the sets were designed pretty well. But it was also kinda amateurish, I've seen much more impressive acrobatics done by far cheaper acts, and the focus on a lot of stupid bs like the crab and giant centipede, that took up like over 10 minutes of pointlessness, totally made for any 5 year olds in the audience I suppose.\\n\\nWe got pretty decent deals ($100/ea, nicely-centered seats in the middle of the arena which are definintely the best seats in the house), but still feel like it was a waste of money.\n",

I really appreciated that she did not take me too far from my element but it was very fresh & new for me. After my appointment I loved the new look so much.. I HAD TO GO OUT AND SHOW IT OFF! She took my boring straight, no volume blonde to a SEXY, fun, vibrant blonde! McKenzie was exactly who I needed to find as my new stylist in Vegas. She can really bring sexy back!

Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.\n",

            "Review: My husband and I ended up at Table 10 by chance while wondering around the Palazzo trying to find a place for dinner.  The good news is that most people eat dinner super late on the strip, so we had no trouble getting a table at a normal dinner hour (around 6:00 P.M.).\\n\\nService was a bit slow at first but then got better.  They were not busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  I'd say we waited a good ten minutes to order drinks.  After that there was a dramatic improvement.\\n\\nI have mixed reviews to offer on the food.  I expected a better cocktail sauce to be served with the oysters.  In fact, we had much better oysters at a more reasonable price the next day at the Palace (right off the strip).  My husband's salmon was out of this world excellent--the best I've ever tasted.  On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special.  That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing.  My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor.  Thankfully, I was saved by dessert.  We ordered and scarfed down the White Chocolate Malassadas, which are little donuts with white chocolate on the inside and cinnamon sprinkled on the outside.  Oh . . . my . . .God!!!!  Yes, they were THAT good.\n",

The other day we bought some chapatis (Indian bread) with 22nd June '09 expiry clearly marked on it. When we opened the packet for dinner we found nothing but green fungus.

            "Review: I joined the crew last night for the HH organized by the fabulous Christina P. Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input. \\n\\nPhoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!\\n\\nService was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.\\n\\nThe manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!\\n\\nIn addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.\\n\\nI was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future.\n",

I cancelled my membership today.\\n\\nthe gym itself is nice in that it's conveniently located and membership is crazy cheap. it's a very no-frills gym, but you know that going in to it. I just needed a place to do some cardio so i could pretend i was getting in shape, and this place was perfect for that. I never had to wait for a machine, it was never too crowded, the staff was always friendly.\\n\\nhere's my bone to pick: there are only two ways you're allowed to cancel your membership: in person, or with certified mail including a $25 check for the termination policy. \\n\\nSo when I moved across the country, they weren't exactly super helpful. I called and tried to cancel, they weren't exactly accommodating. yes, it's 2013 but they wouldn't let me cancel anything by phone or online. It HAD to be in person, or certified mail. they're going out of their way to be obnoxious about cancelling. I have to believe it's actually MORE difficult for them to take a cancellation by mail than it would be to just do it on the phone or online. They do it just to be annoying. \\n\\nadmittedly, this fell off my radar for a bit as i just moved across the country and was starting a new job. i had to get a new credit card, cancelled the old one, then youfit starting calling about not being able to process my billing. that's when they came back on my radar. \\n\\nagain i called and tried to cancel. the nice man there sounded like he understood the issue but his hands were tied. I reasoned with him long enough and he finally said he'd have the GM call me back. The GM called me back and basically he finally agreed to let me be the exception and cancel over the phone, but not before paying late fees and paying for months of membership during which i wasn't even in that time zone. \\n\\nIn that guy's defense, i feel like he actually probably stuck his neck out a little for me and corporate would be mad if they saw he cancelled my account remotely. that's basically why they are 2 stars instead of 1 - on some level i feel like they cared. just the corporate overlords suck.\n",

After the meal, I orgasmed so hard that I rolled my eyes back to the point of seizing. The service was pretty good considering it was rush hour lunch time. The waiter was friendly. I mean even I can't hold a grudge against a guy goes so far as to apologize for being a bit late with our order. The decor was pretty kick-ass. It really made me picture how classy British gentlemen would have taken their meals back in the day. If I remember correctly, they also have a vast selection of spirits, including some home-brewed ones. My only complaint was that the price-portion ratio was a bit upsetting. Since I am a poor student with a voracious appetite, it sucks when good food costs quite a bit. I could have easily ordered another meal if doing so would not have made me appear like a glutton before my friend. Alas, the price we pay for quality!

            "Review: So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp. \\n\\nI looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out. \\n\\nWe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \\n\\nSo, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.\\n\\nWe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \\n\\nVerdict, \\n\\nthe garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\\n\\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\\n\\nthe Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be \\\"OISHI\\\" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up. \\n\\nthe cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.\\n\\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \\n\\non to the rolls,\\n\\nthe Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.\\n\\nthe Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\\n\\nthe Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\\n\\nthe appetizers,\\n\\nthe agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not \\\"bite-size\\\" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be. \\n\\nthe seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.\\n\\nthe grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\\n\\nthe baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \\n\\nI was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\\n\\nI knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \\\"asian\\\" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented \\\"I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.\\\"\\n\\nWith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \\n\\nHm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\\n\\nOn a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.\n",

Perhaps I had my hopes up too high.\\n\\nI went here for a quick bite as I had business in the neighborhood. I must say, I would have done better anywhere else. The salad selection was less than fresh to say the least. A person kept barging out of the back to refill things, and was super surley. Just get in her way and get an elbow.\\n\\nAfter the salad selection are random canned things. I guess those were ok. I am not sure.\\n\\nThey also have a \\\"hot bar\\\". This is where things get really depressing. They had a kind-of taco set-up thing going with what appeared to be ground beef. Except it wasn't! It was straight-up textured vegetable protein! Who even does that? I got a baked sweet potato, and that thing had been sitting under a heat lamp for what seemed weeks and was inedible. The soups were just blah. Who serves french onion soup without the topping? The pizzas they had on the platter were less than what you would expect from the cheapest of frozen pizzas.\\n\\nJust all in all horrible. I left having drank and unsweetened ice tea and left a plate from the all-you-can-eat salad bar totally full.\\n\\nWhat a waste of time and money. This place is gross.\n",

I bought a family membership, which was pretty expensive, we visited a couple of times, and that was plenty. The exhibits are always the same and kind of boring, except for whatever traveling exhibit they may have, and that costs extra on top of your membership!

When I brought this to the attention of Michelle, the owner, she advised me it was not a big deal and that prospective tenant's don't even listen to the message but just leave a voice mail expressing interest in viewing the property.\\n\\n2. Turn-around time to get the property rent-ready (carpet cleaning, painting, etc) was 26 days. (in my experience, it's been between 2-7 days after tenant moves out).\\n\\n3.it takes a while for them to return your calls/emails, in fact it is their policy to get back to you within 48-72 hours. In my experience from dealing with other PM (property management), it's usually a few hours to 24 hrs. Their standard answer was that they were \\\"short-staffed\\\". An interesting fact though, 3 months after I left them, I emailed to get a lost invoice, and I received an automated email response stating they were short-staffed and will get back to me within 72 hours.\\n\\n4.they did not change the lock between tenants, which we learnt about when we were picking up the keys from them to hand it over to another PM.\\n\\nOverall, I am very happy I switched to another property management. No PM is perfect, but I would not recommend this PM. Do your research and do not rush. There are better property managements out there.\\nGood luck!\\nSarah :)\n",

            "Review: A few years ago we vacationed in San Diego and had amazing chicken and waffles from Hash House A Go Go.  On our trip to Vegas, we kept with tradition and decided to go there for breakfast.  We went the same weekend of a college basketball tournament, so the place was packed.  The turnover seemed pretty fast, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Their breakfast menu is intimidating, they have so many tempting options.  One tip, i remember from the past is that their portions are large.  We had been eating out all week, and i just wanted a simple meal.  I ordered the two egg breakfast with potatoes, bacon, and a biscuit.  The whole meal was bad, the only thing that was edible were the eggs.  The 2 measly strips of bacon had every drop of fat rendered out, it was way too crisp.  The potatoes, i did like the addition of the red onions, but they were bland, they needed seasoning. How do you name your self Hash House, and not serve amazing potatoes?   They have a biscuit or toast option, and i was never asked so i assumed they they would bring me toast, instead a very dense biscuit arrived.  My sister ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fruit, and as beautiful as it looked, it was poorly executed.  The banana was simply halved, and still had the peel on.  The melon was peeled but it was segmented into enormous pieces.  I don't think that when you eat out that you yourself should have to prepare you own meal.  Also, i don't know if this is standard or if someone in the kitchen was attempting art, but they smeared blackberries around the rim of the plate, it was very off putting.\\n\\nOverall, i was very disappointed at the lack of consistency within the restaurant chain.  I really hope that it was just an off day, because i  like what they stand for for and the dishes they are able to put out.\n",

It gets SUPER LOUD in here, so I stood clear of the speakers. The venue is also super well ventilated, so much that I even got a little chilly after standing still for a bit. The Brooklyn Bowl also didn't fill  up too bad so I never felt claustrophobic. Paying for a ticket to see live music here is probably cheaper than paying the entrance fee to some ridiculous club.

When I saw previews about Zarkana I was pretty excited for its arrival. Without giving away too much about the show I'll just list the pro's and con's:\\n\\nBAD:\\n\\n- There was too much singing involved. I'm not 100% sure about this show but for other Cirque shows their songs are from made up languages. So essentially you're just listening to people sing and screech in gibberish.\\n\\n- The acrobatics were pretty boring and they kept on screwing up to the point it got annoying. This happened for at least 3-4 of the acts. \\n\\n- There might be a deeper meaning that I probably didn't understand but nobody in our group of 4 understood what the show was about.\\n\\nGOOD:\\n\\n- The  cannon scene.\\n\\n\\nI would definitely NOT recommend this show to anyone. It was insanely boring, the story lacked direction and the singing was very annoying. KA still reigns supreme for Cirque shows(seen O, Zumanity, Ka and Zarkana). If you want humor I would highly suggest watching Absinthe in Caesars, which is our favorite show in Vegas.\n",

It was a Saturday so I used my AAA road side assistance (12 year member) to have it towed to The Car Shop. With the great reviews and the AAA recommendations I did not hesitate to have the work completed on my 1987 V-10 Custom Deluxe. They completed the work in a timely fashion.

I asked if they had tested it after the \\\"repair\\\" work was complete. They said, \\\"No\\\". It is common practice to test something that has been fixed. I spoke with the manager and we had a disagreement about what was wrong with the truck. He refused to fix it and wanted to charge me an additional $200.00 to fix something I already paid him to fix ($326.00). Needless to say I took my truck back to my original mechanic and they solved the problem right away. Problem resulting in a kinked hose - the one they replace. The arrogance and dishonesty from the manager was nothing short of a disappointment.

Tender, seasoned and grilled perfectly.  Always cooked to order.  The specialty platters are enormous, so don't order unless you are hungry.  The Greek Salad has a near perfect light and flavorful dressing, the only downside is depending on who is in the kitchen you may get overly large lettuce chunks which makes eating awkward.  It is recommended you ask them to toss your salad for you, it will evenly spread the dressing and Fetta around - completely changes the flavor and quality.\\n\\nIf you like hummus, get the hummus with seasoned beef. Out of this world and simple but flavorful.  \\n\\nThe decor and ambience are the only downsides.  You feel like you are in a covered hotel banquet room, or having dinner at a retirement home.

A few of the staff there are fantastic, but, they randomly handle tables and so you sometimes may wait to get acknowledged.

I have ordered sometimes, showed up 45 minutes later, and they were still not ready.  If you don't tell them you need it fast, you will wait a while.

            "Review: Not so much. My wife and I love coffee and we have tried a lot of different coffees and coffee houses. This one was like hot water with no flavor or character whatsoever. We both had the cappuccino with skim and it was flavorless. The barista graciously replaced these with a cold mocha which we took to go. These were just as bad and ended up down the drain. On the up side, the breakfast sandwiches were good (not great). All in all for us this place was not worth the trip from where we live and we won't be back.\n",

They wash your car with an oil change which is awesome. Buuuut....\\n\\nLast time I went there they turned me away for an oil change. This is after I called to ask if I needed an appointment for an oil change. They told me they wouldn't be too busy. I get there and he says, \\\"Oh we are busy. And our guys are on lunch so we can't fit you in.\\\" Okay, I get it you are busy. So offer me an appointment for the next day? Next two days? Next week. Nope, sent me packing and off to another place to get my oil changed. Boo. I thought the customer service had really gone down. Previously they were decently nice and gave me the time of day. I will try it again to see if it's better. But I won't wait there.\\n\\nI cannot get over how gross the waiting room of this place is!\\n\\nIt's like they don't believe in vaccuming or cleaning off their tables. I can't believe the waiting area was so dirty. Crumbs EVERYWHERE! They had wifi which was a win. But I didn't even want to put my computer on the table because it was too disgusting. And then sitting in the crumb filled chair. Ew. Honda Shadyside needs some sprucing up.\n",

            "Review: A gorgeous park for us lucky locals! It has been my top 2 favorite parks in Summerlin for years. \\n\\nThis beautiful wash park is great for walking/running/biking, picnic, kids playing, walking the dogs, soccer and basketball practice...and even \\\"Hiking\\\"! Yes, hiking, too! Read on, if interested.\\n- Oh yes, this park is very well maintained by the landscape crew and patrolled by the park security. The entire park is wheelchair accessible.\\n\\n- Its paved path, with pleasant views of the washbeds and the nice houses on the banks above, stretches out to 1.7 gentle miles long from the main Entrance on Lake Mead (west side of Buffalo) to the Rampart end. \\n\\n- There are TWO beautiful, large grass lawns (on each side of Pueblo Vista), several covered pavilions with grills and picnic tables, three playgrounds, a small basketball court...even a small corner with \\\"fitness exercise stations\\\" in the open rest area/playground by the Rampart end.\\n- There are plenty of places for resting. Besides pavilions, there are also park benches thoughtfully placed every 0.25mi or so on the path for you to enjoy the beauty of the park in peace! At the Rampart end by the golf course, there are 2 more small rest courts on each side the overpass/tunnel, one of which has a chessboard on its table.\\n-  It has bathroom facilities by the front entrance side. For the Rampart side, there is no restroom, but one could use the facility in the Trent Park Sports Complex on Vegas/Rampart, 0.2mi up.\\n- For parking, besides the lots beyond the main entrance off Lake Mead, there are parking spaces also on Pueblo Vista St (off Lake Mead), right above the tunnel/overpass, nearby the Lutheran Church and school. There are paved paths off the street overpass leading into the park.\\n\\nSOMETHING EXTRA:\\n- To extend the walking distance, one can branch out by going up and down the paths to/from resident areas. For even greater distance, you can also walk another 0.2mi on Vegas towards Rampart to get into the \\\"Trent Park Sports Complex\\\" around the corner. BTW: This park is worth a visit, too. \\n\\n- For the more adventurous, one can \\\"hike\\\" on several sections of WASH BEDS and/or on the upper DIRT Trails along the school fence or along the perimeters of the residential wall - it'd be almost like HIKING! (see pics). \\n- Enjoy your \\\"HIKE\\\" but do be CAREFUL and stay clear of areas where there are watering dripper/sprinklers, and have a good pair of walking/hiking shoes.\\n\\nBTW: I noted that Yelper Daniel S. had already given an outstanding review on this park a few months back, which is informative and a pleasure to read!\\n- Here, I really just wanted to add that in Pueblo, one can ALSO (1) do some \\\"In-City Hiking\\\" and (2) extend walking distance.\\n\\nPeterskis, Nov 2012\\n----\n",

Attentive but not excessive. \\n\\nMy colleague and I both started with the special salad of the night and it was excellent! A chopped salad with a creamy basil dressing. With the bread it could have been a meal in itself.  \\n\\nFor dinner I had the crab cakes which I was told was their most popular item. They were also excellent, two large mounds of crab with just enough filler to hold them together served with a spicy sauce. My colleague had the filet and it was good but not as tender as one would expect.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the banana bread pudding and it was very good. Big enough to share. More cake-like than a traditional bread pudding.\\n\\nLike all high end Vegas steak houses this place is expensive, maybe a bit too expensive. In this price range you can do a bit better even in Vegas. So overall I give it four stars.\n",

            "Review: My friend and I bought the Groupon for it when it was available and were both pumped to eat there.  Unfortunately, I think A n' A still have some work to do to.\\n\\nFirst, the positives:  \\n1.  The space on the inside and outside was beautiful.  Love the decor.  Stylish and comfortable.\\n2.  The bar is definitely on point.  Fantastic beer selections, friendly bartender.  A little expensive but nothing unheard of for the area.  My friend got a rum and coke, which I think was $7, but it was so strong it was definitely worth it.  My fiance and I both got Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPAs, one of our favorites, and they were both $7, which for a beer with 9% ABV isn't out of this world.  \\n3.  The wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive, even when busy.  There was some confusion initially when we walked in about seating, so maybe they should have a clearer \\\"check in\\\" area.  Overall pleased with the service, especially for a new establishment.\\n\\nUnfortunately there are important areas that are negatives for our A n' A experience.\\n\\n1.  I don't want to be rude, but there was an odd stench throughout the entire restaurant.  There were people eating mussels, but this was not a fresh seafood smell.  This was more of a garbagey/pet store smell.  All four of us smelled it, but maybe it didn't bother others as much as it did us.\\n\\n2.  The food was just OK.  My fiance got the pierogies, which at $16 you would assume be enough food for an entree.  What it consisted of was about 8 small pierogies with corn and bacon tossed on top.  He said it was OK, but he was still hungry.  These would be a much better appetizer.  Me and my friend both got the house salad, and I had chicken added to mine.  These were good salads with decent dressings, my only minor complaint is that there were way too many olives and way too little cheese.  Another friend got the Alchemy Fries and said they were good and they gave him a ton of them.\\n\\n3.  There was no 3G in the restaurant and there was no Wifi available.  Minor complaint, but noticeable since this is becoming common place for trendy new restauants.\\n\\nFor what I was expecting, Alchemy n' Ale was a disappointment.  For the prices and space, the food should be much, much better.  The comparable restaurants in the L-Ville area offer so much better quality food for less.  The menu seems kind of random and all over the place, so maybe they haven't found their identity yet.  I did see a plate of mac n' cheese go by that looked great, so maybe I'll give it another try.  \\n\\nThis place has promise, so I hope it improves so we have another fantastic place to go to in L-Ville.\n",

The maitre d was okay... not super friendly but not a complete dousche... and he had to ID me before sitting in the lounge because he thought I wasn't 21 yet. I'm flattered. Anywho... didn't get any appetizers as nothing seemed appealing... so we went straight into dinner. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the fried seafood platter which she liked... she let me sample some of it... and honestly to me, it was just fried seafood. Nothing fancy.\\n\\nI was caught between the shrimp scampi (I heart scampi) and the parmesan halibut.

I also ordered a blush wine and I don't know the name of it (I asked the waitress and SHE didn't even know... um... FAIL!!!) but it was delicious so I'll shut up about that. The scampi came, and well, it looked sad. Yes the shrimp was large, but it was overcooked and there was NO taste to the pasta. Seriously??  A restaurant of this caliber with this reputation and the scampi has NO taste?? Unimpressed. Also, the king crab mac and cheese had no taste as well. I'm not a fan of adding salt to ANY dish... but I felt like BOTH dishes needed salt but like I said, I don't like to add salt. There was BARELY any king crab in the dish as well. LAME!!!

I would definitely stay here again. Our room was very nice and CLEAN!! Clean is the biggest issue for me so I was very happy.

The crepes were way overpriced...three crepes, 2 slices of pizza, 2 beers, 2 sodas $65! The room was cramped, armoire broken, TV not viewable from both beds, and the shampoo sucked. Only one pool, 3 ft in all areas- just for toddlers. My hubby & I recently stayed two nights at Venetian- so much better. I plan to write management a letter but realize gone are the days when great food, drinks and service were a Vegas given - plan to be stripped of your last dollar before you even get to the tables!\n",

The local pointed out that St. Francis largely uses locally bought veggies, in particular, while also having great food.\\n\\nWalking into St. Francis, it's clearly an eclectic, fun environment. The menu is just as attractively unusual -- and every appetizer, drink and dish we ordered was delicious and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe goat cheese appetizer wasa good -- the meatball appetizer was great. The almond margarita was unique, tasty and strong. We also had the roast chicken and pork chop - both were excellent. It seemed a little unusual to have just a piece of chicken on the plate, but the \\\"sides\\\" were under the chicken, and on top. The flavor was amazing - the fresh veg made all the difference.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and ready with recommendations. We happened to go at happy hour, which features an impressive range of options - bonus!\\n\\nCan't wait to return to St. Francis next time I'm in Phoenix.\n",

I came across this place when I was just trying to walk off my lunch. I saw a sign and could not resist the pull to walk in. I have a bit of an obsession with the glamour of old burlesque and have read an inordinate amount of information about Gypsy Rose Lee. This was like visiting a holy place I didn't even know existed. \\nI chatted for a few minutes with the front counter woman. She was super nice, friendly and had lots to say about the museum. It consists of a few pictures and some costumes, letters and playbills. Per the young lady, they rotate their displays fairly constantly due to the space restrictions. Its only about the size of one room. \\nThis stop was worth it just for the great conversation. This lady was so knowledgeable about not just burlesque but about Las Vegas. I really wish I would've taken her name. She deserves a shout-out. She gave me directions back  to the bus stop and even went through her entire t-shirt stock to find me a size small. I took home a light pink Blaze Starr top. It'll be great for the gym \\nIf you have even a slight interest in burlesque, this is a great place to spend a few minutes.\n",

I am not that big of a meat eater and 2. because it is kind of pricey in there.\\n\\nRecently I became very aware of GMO's in our food and the whole Monsanto situation. I decided that from now on I will only buy grass fed beef because we don't know if the cows that are corn fed, are being fed with GMO corn. Most likely they are because it would be VERY expensive to feed them organic corn. However, I felt like Von Hanson's would surely have grass fed beef right? So I happily made my way on over to VH's. I selected the cut I wanted, and as the butcher was taking it out of the cooler..I asked him if any of the meat was grass fed. I guess I was assuming he was going to tell me that it was grass fed..Unfortunately, he told me that NO...ALL of their meats are corn fed. \\n\\nI left with my cut of meat, but I still felt a little disappointed that they didn't have ANY grass fed meat there. \\n\\nVon Hanson's...if you can respond and let us know if your beef is fed GMO free corn...I will change my rating and update my review. Until then, sadly, ...I willl not be back.\n",

Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it's an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\\n\\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \\\"Your waitress will be right with you.\\\"  me:  \\\"But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\\\"  \\\"Ill tell the waitress.\\\"  me:  \\\"Please may i just have my beer?\\\"  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \\\"Oh, I didn't see you, weren't you outside?\\\"  If you didn't see me how would you notice I was outside?\\n\\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I'm easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \\\"cool.\\\"  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that's ok i think we pissed her off.\\n\\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It's extremely frustrating.\\n\\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\\n\\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you'll be back.\\n\\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you've got to come here and be very very patient.\n",

The waitress said they had not gotten things unpacked from the delivery truck yet despite the restaurant opening around 2pm daily. The main course was linguine with clam sauce. The sauce was good but the pasta was SUPER al dente. I mean near raw. I know some chefs rave over this concept of semi-uncooked pasta but in the real world we eat it fully cooked. And being a chef myself I can say that this was overly al dente. Dessert was wonderful with no complaints. I wish I just ordered three of them to be my appetizer and main course.\n",

I had been seeing a girl I loved - Brittany - then she left and went to open the Cardiff location. I felt lost, even went to Cardiff once while in San Diego to get my nails done by her again. Finally, I found a great replacement. Then SHE left and I was stuck with someone I didn't know. It was the worst manicure I had ever gotten and I called to cancel my 20 Lounge membership.\\n\\nI got a call back from the manager Debbie. I was a shellac fiend. She convinced me to come in and see her and let her give me a replacement gel manicure. I surely wasn't going to survive without redoing the manicure immediately so I gave her one last shot.\\n\\nI've found my new love. I've been seeing Debbie now for almost 2 years and I absolutely ADORE her. She does the most amazing gel and it lasts me 3-4 weeks. She knows when I travel we need to go shorter in length, summer is French, and winter she surprises me with fun colors or glitter fades. Plus, she's a blast to talk to and I want to talk to her!!! She's positive, beautiful inside and out, and it's like therapy and a mani/pedi all in one!\\n\\nThe place is so clean. It's beautiful. It's priced appropriately. There are no \\\"FUMES\\\" like the ones you take in while sitting at those other nail salons. You know which ones I am talking about...\\n\\nLet's talk pedicures. Sure it's a little different and awkward to stick your feet in a bowl vs. the massage chairs with bubbling hot water... BUT... my argument on this is that at least they aren't using a dremel to remove the gel and ruining your nail!!!! And there is no way they are going to recommend you need an eyebrow wax while you're trying to relax (HELLO!)\\n\\nI'll end by saying this: If you purchased a Groupon and live in Glendale, don't bother. However, if you are in the Scottsdale or surrounding area and haven't been back for a few years - maybe you'll give them another chance. I did!\n",

This place is really famous for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. I've tried their coffee flavored and i have to say it was pretty good. The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price. It's the ambience, location, and that frozen hot chocolate that you're kind of paying for. I recommend that you have a Total Rewards card because there is a discount for that. Enjoy the that Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!\n",

Fast food patty on a fat bun. \\nA fat bun? Yes. The bun is soaked in butter and almost an inch of bread on either side of a mcdonalds thin patty. My burger was pink, is that even safe? There weren't that many people there yet they forgot my grilled onions. Normally I'd say something but it became obvious after two bites it would suck with or without onions, so whatever. The taste I see people raving about is steak salt. Fries are ok. Not sure why everyone says the tomato and lettuce are so super fresh, I mean it's not rubber but I wouldn't call it fresh either. \\nIf I come through Phoenix again I'll try something besides the Modern Burger, I think the only \\\"modern\\\" thing about it was trying to sell people a shitty product for more money.\n",

            "Review: We went here for dinner.  \\nStarted off with garlic rolls were good.  Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic vinegar were provided on the table for dipping.  The Balsamic vinegar was sweeter and not as acrid as the one from DOCG.  I accompanied my meal with a Moretti, an Italian beer and really liking this over Peroni.  There is less of an aftertaste and more pleasing to my palate.\\n\\nOrdered the Linguine Carbonara.  I wanted to taste it so I have a reference of how it should taste.  Most comments online say why order it when you can just make it at home.  They are correct.   Most restaurants serve carbonara but they often add heavy cream and a whole bunch of other items.  Trattoria Reggiano was the only one I found that serves it how it is should to be, Pancetta, Cheese, Egg, and Pasta, that's it.  Overall, the taste was close to how I make it so I'm glad I'm in the general vicinity.  The criticism I have though is that they a used a little too much pancetta and the sauce could have been a little looser.  Additionally, there was little or no black pepper.  Should have asked for freshly cracked black pepper but instead used black pepper on the table, which didn't add much.\\n\\nMy friend had the Chicken Marsala.  It was very good.  The dish overall was not greasy.  The sauce had a lot of flavor.  Unlike a lot of Chicken Marsala we get in Hawaii where they use too much butter/oil where it masks the Marsala and chicken flavors.\\n\\nRegarding they other parts of the meal, service was ok.  It lacked in the beginning but picked up later on.  Didn't really care to eat outside in the mall as the tables were too close to each other.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place if you are looking for simply Italian food.\n",

The service failure by Tom in the pro shop was to much for me to overlook however. As I walked into the pro shop, Tom was dealing with a customer that was complaining about being overcharged on his credit card for a belt he had purchased the week prior. At the time, Bear's Best was running a special for $59 which included a free drink and a coupon for a play at the $59 rate in January 2012. I paid him for my round with three twenty dollar bills. He gave me my receipt and I asked him for my dollar change. He began getting defensive and told me he thought he already gave it to me. I told him, no he didn't - so he begrudgingly gave me a dollar. I went out to my golf partner and told him of the bizarre behavior I had just witnessed. My partner then asked me if I had received my free drink card and replay certificate. I said no I hadn't and headed back into the pro shop. When I politely asked for the free drink card and replay certificate, he said he had already given me one. I told him he hadn't and he became really belligerent towards me. I was really shocked. I did note the security cameras in the shop and asked him to go check his security footage. Tom then stated he didn't have access to the footage, but he would \\\"give me another one\\\". I was getting upset at this point, and I pointed out to him, he wasn't \\\"giving me another one\\\" but rather the one he failed to give me the first time. I then told him he could read about my encounter with him on Yelp. Tom stated he had no idea what I was talking about. Unless you are getting a great deal you can't pass up to play Bear's Best, I would suggest going to Siena Golf Club or Arroyo Golf Club right next door, or Angel Park a few miles away.\n",

            "Review: I was really impressed with this hotel on my recent trip to Vegas for a girls weekend. The hotel itself is very impressive, the decor is amazing and so well thought out. The hotel is fairly new so doesn't have that haggard look but actually they've kept it up well. The casino is open and airy (not smokey at all) and somehow doesn't feel as claustrophobic as other casinos in Vegas. The rooms are great! Very modern with mirrors everywhere and clean lines. Remote control drapes and sheers as well as lights. We stayed in a king suite so had the benefit of a separate living room with a couch. It was nice to be able to have a pregame cocktail without having to sit on a bed. The bathroom was gorgeous, double sinks, large tub, shower with two heads and lots of nice bath products (although the shampoo and conditioner could be upgraded). I laughed when I read another reviewers comment about the toilet being too high, I felt the same way! Like a little kid with my legs dangling! The toilet is a little aggressive too when you flush, but who's complaining?? The pools are nice. They have options, you can go to the family pool or the \\\"European\\\" pool (bikini tops optional). You can also use pools at Wynn. The younger crowd pools are fun with pumping music and hot bodies everywhere. The family pools are more relaxing and peaceful. Both have free water and towels and plenty of servers to bring you a cocktail, although you'll pay dearly for it! I will say the pool areas are lacking good food options, all of the items on the menu are premade sandwiches and salads and didn't appeal to me. The restaurants inside the hotel are great, although again pretty pricey (what do you expect??). They all have an Asian flair but the two we ate in, Wazuzu and Wing Lei were great! The crowd is younger on the weekend and apparently XS and Tryst are two of the hottest clubs in town so be prepared to see a bunch of young girls in too short dresses and walking around barefoot after they gave in to their 6 inch platform heels (yeah I'm not bitter! LOL). Of all the hotels in Vegas I have stayed at, I would definitely go back here.\n",

The Christmas lights strung in the window is what caught my eye and led me here. \\n\\nWe were warmly greeted by a husband and wife team. We were the only diners at the time, he gave us a very thorough run down of the menu items and had suggested the CC Sizzle, we picked Nacho Style. This was delicious. It was a blend of meat with onions, cabbage and cheese over their homemade tortilla chips. Our second item was the Green Chile Enchiladas, made with Hatch green chili's and chicken with creamy chili's sauce. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. \\n\\nWe ended the meal with Sopaipillas. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I like mine with honey, and they had a few different types to choose from. \\n\\nThis place is really casual. Even if you're dining in, your food is served in styrofoam to go container. The soda fountain wasn't working when we were there, bummer, I like a nice cold Coke when I'm eating Mexican food (only time I like soda). The owners were really nice, he was telling us all about where they're from in NM. I'm definitely planning to return and try some of their other dishes.\n",

Upon small talk with the manager that the front area is disorganized, he had no comment, just stayed mum. He threw my ID back unto the table and slid it towards me.

A large, juicy burger was very good and a steak that was just ok round out the standard fare. The nachos appetizer was not great, but it was just an appetizer.  The real star was the pizza. The dough is buttery and flakey yet chewy which made for one of the best pizza crusts that I have ever had. The sauce and cheese were well balanced to make this a wonderful personal pizza.

They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. \\n\\nI had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). \\n\\nService is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. \\nMy family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options.

            "Review: No complaints about the quality of the haircut, but during my fourth visit, the barber (Bob) cutting my hair started negotiating price about halfway through the haircut.  Their standard price for a haircut is $15, and on my previous visits I've given him a $5 tip.  He said that haircuts \\\"like mine\\\" are extra work (I have thick hair, which requires using thinning shears), and he feels that I should pay $25 (!) for all the \\\"extra work\\\".  In over 40 years, I have *never* had a barber complain about my hair being hard to cut.  If he had said this up front, I would have walked out, but I couldn't really leave in the middle of a haircut.  Needless to say, I will be exploring other options in the future.\\n\\nUPDATE - I complained to the owner (Ernie), and he was very eager to make things right.  He said to come back next time and ask for him, and the haircut would be on the house.  I did, and was quite pleased with the result.  After a number of repeat visits over a period of a couple years (until I moved away), I would not hesitate to recommend this place - just avoid Bob (the old guy in the far back).\n",

            "Review: After being pleased with Cirque du Soliel's Mystere, I made the mistake of letting my winnings ride, and I bet on another Cirque show: \\\"Zumanity.\\\" A show written for, and apparently by, confused hormonal eighth-graders. \\n\\nA friend of mine has a favorite saying when he goes to strip clubs: \\\"Let's not spoil it with words.\\\" (Anyone who has attempted to have a conversation with a stripper knows EXACTLY what he means.) Well, someone should have given that advice to whomever conceived of Zumanity. I haven't seen such brainless, low-brow attempts at sexual humor and dialogue since I was in junior high school. Zumanity makes the \\\"American Pie\\\" movies seem like works of Shakespeare. \\n\\nThe M.C. of Zumanity is some over-acted Dr. Frankenfurter-esque drag queen, who was given to some awful, trite little lines like, \\\"Isn't making love beautiful?\\\" like he was addressing a gathering of 17th century Calvinists who need convincing that sexual pleasure will not land them a place in eternal damnation. (This audience paid good money to see topless women trapeze through the air. You can safely skip the lecture.) The whole show was just an awkward mish-mash of, on one hand, graceful and suggestive acrobatic performances, and the other hand, crass and overt sexual humor. They need to pick a direction and stick with it; just trying slap them together is a trainwreck. If you're trying to lube us all up for a post-show hotel room fuck session, then why have a confrontational old drag-queen up there making everyone's skin crawl. The mass tightening of sphincters was nearly audible every time he/she made direct eye contact with the audience. I'm not exactly a prude...I managed to sit through an entire ice-skating performance of Johnny Weir in a lace corset without writing my Congressman...but I was short-stack of dimes for the entire 90 minutes of this so-called erotica. Even the obligatory orgy scene at the finale failed to register on the trusty ole' Bone-o-Meter. (Yes, the Bone-o-Meter makes a cameo!)\\n\\nThere were a few redemptive moments, when the incredible athletes took the spotlight and did their thing. There was a stunning trapeze act with a guy swinging by one foot over the audience (without a net), an aerial-bound female orgasm (this one definitely got my attention), and other mildly clever performances involving a pearly white ribbons (hint, hint!) and a cage match between male rivals. But there wasn't enough of these acrobatic performances to save the show. It's like they ran dry after a few good ideas, and then just filled up the rest of the time with dick jokes.\n",

            "Review: I came here to late night happy hour with a friend. They don't have a liquor licence, so the only thing missing was creative cocktails, but the Nigori sake was a rather pleasant quaff.  Don't let the milky appearance put you off; it's a gorgeous smooth drink, and quite a large measure for the $3 happy hour price!  Oh, and it didn't sit right with me that the drinks menu included such low-rent yellow fizz as Bud Light (really?  Who would have Bud flipping Light with this food?  I don't get that).  Minor quibbles that really don't take away from my 5-star rating because the food is enough to get there.  At first glance, it seems a little expensive, but, as I've said before on Yelp, we get what we pay for.\\n\\nAnd so to the food.  Oh, my stars!  The fooooood!!!  I frankly don't think the people dissing the food for too many flavors are totally sane.  All of the flavors were subtle and beautifully balanced.  Trying to balance a slice of dehydrated pear, toasted almond, dehydrated fig, leafy herb thingy, and pesto-y sauce on a piece of hamachi sashimi slippery with house-made fish oil sauce and getting it all to the mouth with chopsticks was admittedly not an easy venture, but it was worth the slapstick effort on the first chew when flavor explosions of sheer delight decorated the palate with joy!  We had the Omakase 8 courser, which is a tasting menu that changes according to the chef's creative whims on the day.  There was nothing in it that we didn't love or at least like very very much.  With each mouthful of an eclectic mix of flavors, some that appeared really incongruous, like the amuse bouche strawberry with fish sauce (say what?!), salt, pepper, and some funny little leaves that I can't remember the name of, we MMMMM'd and rolled our eyes in pure delight at each new flavor sensation. The portion sizes were very reasonable, and we were satisfied without being overstuffed, even after the to-die-for chocolaty dessert concoction, which was the perfect conclusion to an outstanding meal. \\n\\nThe service was generally good, if a bit...what's the word?  Juggly?  We seemed to have a different server for each course.  It just seemed slightly strange, but everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our courses came out mostly in excellent time, not too slow, not too fast, with plenty of time to savor each course and let its moment pass whilst enjoying each other's company.  \\n\\nWe couldn't figure out why it wasn't busier at late night happy hour (it was steady but not packed) on a Friday night (maybe location?  maybe no liquor licence?  maybe the word hasn't gotten out yet?). I hope it picks up because this is going to be one of my go-to places for beautiful food.  \\n\\nYataaaaaa, Yonaka!!! :)\n",

Not only was the food really tasty and the atmosphere super fun, but you also handled our very serious food allergies with such patience and detail. From showing us labels to bringing in special buns, you really went above and beyond.  The night could not have been more perfect. How can we thank you enough?  All I can say is I so hope that this gem of a place is saved - what a loss it would be to Scottsdale if this place closes. Save Greasewood!!!!!\n",

We spent Christmas Eve here two years in a row, and with a party of 11, not one bad dish! Z'Tejas is kid friendly which is a bonus. Leo's Street Tacos are my favorite along with their Skillet Dumplings. The two combined with a small Caesar salad make for a great meal.\n",

            "Review: I stopped by on a hot Sunday afternoon, after my massage, and just when I thought the massage put me in a good mood...no no, it's the tasty cakes, delicious poke, and the unexpected guava filled malasada that was given to me, that put in in a super great mood.\\n\\nThe poke was pricey, but it is what the market price is.  My half pound of container filled with poke came out to $7.77.  I got the creamy sauce with a hint of sriracha, green scallions and white onions.  I would like to try the shoyu and the garlic sauce next time.  \\n\\nAll the cakes look so delicious, but because I am on a healthy streak, I limited myself to two only.  I got the chantilly ($4) and guava cake ($3.75).  My bf, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, kept coming back for more bites while I was enjoying the chantilly cake.   It was a moist chocolate devil cake, with two layers of custard like frosting.  It has the perfect level of sweetness (not overly sweet).  Yum yum.\\n\\nThe guava cake was delish.  I had that the next day prior to hitting the gym, and the cake was still so moist.  It truly tastes like guava.  Gosh, I wanna head back for more, but I can only do so on a cheat day. \\n\\nThe owner is such a friendly and awesome person.  He gave me a guava malasada and that is such a nice gesture.  I totally did not expect that.  Also, it shows how detailed he is since that guava malasada choice must be due to my selection of the guava cake.  \\n\\nI can't wait to go back and try other tasty cakes and a different type of poke.  Yum Yum Yum.\n",

Asked for no mayo or tomatoes. There was so much mayo the sandwich didn't even taste of anything other than mayo. This was not a prep issue this was an ordering issue. They couldn't print a receipt because they had the paper loaded wrong. They got that fixed just as I was leaving with my order. After I got home and found out how screwed up my order was I realized that it was because it wasn't taken correctly in the first place. You have been open for a month, you should be running smoother than this. Good luck I probably won't be back. There are many sandwich places competing for my $$$, I am not sure that Cousins will be in the mix.

            "Review: I booked at this resort for a weekend getaway with my sisters (no kids, no husbands, all Vegas, baby.) It was my first choice because we went in August and I had heard that their pool and beach were the best on the Strip. It was a bit of a disappointment. At check in, I wanted to ask about an upgrade to a larger room, but was flatly refused anything other than a standard 550 sq ft 2 queen room. All suites were booked, nothing available larger than the above. \\nAs soon as I got to the room, I tried to book a cabana for the next day. They had 2 options: one was $325 and the other was $500. This is significantly more than I paid for the room! We decided to take our chances on finding shade. When we went to the pool on Saturday, we could not find a place to sit. Every chair was taken and we ended up folding up our things and piling them in a corner so we could go in the pool. It was not a high-end luxury experience to say the least. Later in the afternoon, we found some chairs in a remote pool area, but it certainly wasn't anything like what I expected. Before booking, I had pictured drifting along the lazy river in a tube, but I never even went in the lazy river. It was full of rambunctious kids and little infants. No thanks. \\nThat evening after dinner, we went to one of the casino bars. I put money in the video poker machine, and we ordered and paid for a round of drinks. When I was ready for another drink, I asked the bartender and he refused to serve me unless I bet the maximum on the machine. I didn't even know what he was talking about. The dude was seriously rude and I was completely baffled. To this day, I don't know why he was so unfriendly. As I said, we'd already bought drinks, I had paid to play, my cute younger sister was up on the dance floor dancing with some dorky bachelor party guys. Why would he be so rude? Fortunately, there are many, many bars in Vegas, so we moved on quickly. Everywhere else we went, staff and other customers were friendly, hospitable and fun. Overall, we had a great vacation, and Mandalay Bay didn't ruin it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a girls getaway. Maybe for families with kids it's fun.\n",

I've had professional massages before and I also work at a high end spa and salon on the LV strip. Tanya was great. Her pressure was just right, she probably could have been firmer but I haven't had a massage in a very long time so that was fine.

As a \\\"foodie\\\" this deeply concerned me. I made the decision that we would train our kids to be well behaved in a restaurant so we could continue to have fun dining experiences. Well, that didn't happen. My son is one of the pickiest eaters and as never ending ants in the pants which makes sitting for long periods of time a challenge. Thankfully for me there are places like Humble Pie. My husband and I really enjoy the pizza and my son seems to enjoy all the food on the children's menu. The location on 7th street has a trendy vibe and if you can get a seat on the patio, there's always great people watching. On top of good food in a cool atmosphere, they're fast and kids eat free on Sundays!! If you're not a parent, you will really enjoy Humble Pie for their food and drinks, but if you're a parent and want good food in a child friendly atmosphere, look no further than here!

            "Review: Holy salty food, Batman!  0_o\\n\\nI had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter.  It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!\\n\\n I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50/50 flour/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the saut\\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.\\n\\nThe inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.  \\n  \\nMy grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.\\n\\nThe buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.  \\n\\nI'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.  This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place.  :/\n",

As for the shrimp and grits, the grits were sticky and bland, and the sausage was flavorless, gritty, and drowning in an oily gravy.  For a price tag of 20 bucks, there should have been more than five shrimp included. \\n\\nThe only save of the evening was the ass-kicking piano player, who worked through a repertoire of big band classics, pop tunes, and a Super Mario Brothers medley that was spot on.\\n\\nBottom line?

            "Review: My husband and I were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place. We decided to check it out. Wow! Am I glad we did. \\n     I did the Build Your Own Bowl and had tofu, no carb option (twice the veggies), with the green curry sauce. The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. \\n   My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.\\n   My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)\\n  It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.\\n   We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air. \\n   If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?  No problem. \\n    I will definitely be back!\n",

NO thank you! \\n\\nThe tarts however were yummy, about 4 bucks or so which is what I would expect, in KC it would have been 5 or 6 dollars. \\n\\nMy biggest issue, the french macaroons. The cookie was made correctly, however the filling was not. It was like they just got jelly from the store and spread it on. And the creme... was it creme?! Idk, but it was horrible! \\n\\nIf you all every had French macaroons you know the filling is what makes the cookie. and I wasted about 12ish dollars on 5 macaroons in which I only ate1/2 of one.

This review is long long long overdue.\\n\\nMe and a bunch of friends (1:1 ratio guys and girls) had guestlist with a promoter who guaranteed us a set price. We've done this a million times in Vegas. The girls would get in free and dudes would fork over $30.\\n\\nWell when we got there, even though the place is f*cking dead, the bouncer asked us to grease his palm $20 a head. Even for girls. I looked at my friend and the bouncer with \\\"are you f'n\\\" serious look. Not wanting to make a big stink, we complied. I think my friend went off the side or bathroom and palmed the guy $20 for each of us.\\n\\nWe ended up ponying up $30 for each guy anyway. I thought that was strange. Later the promoter (who we are cool with) met us up and said what happened shouldn't have happened and the guy should be canned.\\n\\nInside Haze, it was pretty dead. It picked up a bit later on, but the layout is awful.\\n\\nI got trashed though, and actually jumped on one of the platforms and did the booty dance with a bunch of chicks who actually loved it.

Don't do it again.\\\" It didn't seem to bother any of the other patrons and the chicks were telling me come back. Just having fun bro, geez.\\n\\nI think drinks were like $20-$25 each, highway robbery.\\n\\nThe only redeeming factor I guess is the sound system is pretty good, but the actual club is a piece of shit.\\n\\nHaze is definitely a 3rd tier club.

But if this had been my first visit I would never be going back.\\nWent for a Saturday night dinner and drinks treat and expected a lot better. I'd have the meat platter before and was craving it so was disappointed when it was no longer on the menu. When I asked the waitress about it I was reassured they still did it, it just wasn't printed on the menu. I happily handed over my money and sat back in anticipation. But what turned up was worse that dreadful. 4 slices of what i can only assume was Salisbury's bread along with a bundle of salmon, a bowl of haggis, bowl of black pudding and the worst over cooked steak I've ever attempted to eat. And that was all. What happened to the salad, the oatcakes, the chicken, the cooking skills??!! Eventually after prompting, the waitress brought me some cutlery and a few slices of lemon from the bar. \\nI don't know what was going on in Lebowskis on Saturday but it was all dreadful. Our table was filthy, as was the one in the next booth. And no one came to clear our table long after we finished eating. \\nI would have been irritated if I'd been told the platter was no longer available but at least that would have been honest. Instead I was fooled into buying a substandard meal. \\nI think Lebowskis need to make up there minds about what they are offering as there customer experience. At the amazing yelp elite event not even a month ago they were all about gourmet, locally sourced food. Cooked to perfection and served in style. That all went out the window on Saturday. \\nWill i go back, maybe. Should you go......? That's up to you.\n",

I'm not a big fan of the large chain sporting good stores (Sports Authority, Dick's) & thought this place might be a nice change from those. But I was wrong, this is basically the same type of place, just smaller with bigger prices.\\n\\nThey didn't seem to have a vast selection of anything, because they try to sell everything, if that makes sense. They have footwear, college apparel, tennis rackets, fitness apparel, baseball goods, so on & so on. But by their store being limited in size, trying to sell goods for every single sport leaves you with less room to have a big selection within each category. So the items are watered down & they can't specialize in having unique items for every sport, just your basic goods. But I will say the service here seems friendly & willing to help, even though I wasn't in the buying mood.\\n\\nOmega Sports seems like a locally owned sporting goods store trying to directly compete with the big chain sporting good stores. I hate to say it, but they just seem like a smaller, more run down version of these stores with nothing really intriguing to entice customers away from the big chains. If you're looking for a basic sporting good item they'll probably have what you're looking for, but don't expect a vast selection of things.\n",

It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.\\n\\nThe one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something \\\"new\\\" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.\\n\\nProtip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.\\n\\nProtip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing.\n",

Being Italian and from North New Jersey it has been quite a challenge.  So you could imagine the excitement when 2 of my very dear friends have been raving about the Amarone....stating the best Italian restaurant they have found in AZ.  I was extremely disappointed. \\n\\nAs I walked in i quickly noticed how beautifully decorated the restaurant was.  We sat at the bar.  The place was packed, so I quickly thought my friends must be right.  This place must be a gem.  Bartender was nice...didn't go out of his way.  The menu was a bit expensive. \\n\\n$3.50 for a coke!!!  That is a bit much!\\n\\nMy friend got pizza ($18) and I penne alla vodka ($15).  I had to ask for extra sauce as the pasta was VERY dry.  And to be honest....possibly one of the worst dishes of penne vodka I have had.  No flavor!  And the pizza was ok, BUT for $18 I was expecting fantastic.  \\n\\n2 of the waiters came over to talk with us and I felt them to be a bit creepy.  I think they just came back from a cigarette break, but I thin they were smoking something other then a cigarette.  \\n\\nNot one of my favorite.

            "Review: Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.\\n\\nLong-Winded Review:\\nWhen I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo.  Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner.  Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box.  You can get California Rolls at 7-11.  There are hundreds of \\\"Japanese\\\" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian.  Osaka's menu remains largely grounded in its Japanese roots, but it also features a good selection of \\\"custom\\\" sushi rolls that you'll find in other sushi restaurants.  The menu is extensive, and some parts may be difficult to navigate since it is in Japanese (or the English equivalent, Romaji).  Item descriptions are all too brief and unless you've been there before, you may be intimidated by ordering something new.  It's probably best to ask your server or sushi chef questions before ordering.  What troubles me about Osaka is that I feel it's trying to be all things to all people.  It serves authentic Japanese fare, but it's also trying to be edgy, trendy, and hip by offering experimental fusion dishes and desserts.  However, the fact that I still go there regularly suggests that Osaka's experimentation doesn't bother me all that much.  As with older Japanese restaurants, prices are a tad higher than other places in town ($15 for chicken teriyaki dinner vs. $9.95 at other places), but the quality is much better.  You're not going to get as much food, but if you're looking for quantity, I can suggest some good all-you-can-eat sushi places that will feed you for under $30.\\n\\nThe real value of Osaka is its late night menu (10 pm - 2 am).  It features a wide variety of food for under $10.  You can get rolls and appetizers for $5 or less, and entrees are available for under $10.  The Japanese Style Beef Bowl is a steal at $5.80 (it's like a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, but tastier).  It's a great place to go with friends after/before clubbing since you can do a family-style meal.\\n\\nDesserts are hit or miss.  The Tempura Ice Cream is a great value at $5.50 and it easily serves 2-4 people.  Some of the other items are good, but definitely not worth the high price.\n",

If you like plates fresh out of the dishwasher that are still hot with crusted food on them, and this was with multiple plates, this is your buffet. If you are extremely sodium deficient this is your buffet. If you like carved meats that make you wish for a meat tenderizer to beat them with this is your buffet. If you like semi-frozen out of the box desserts this is definitely your buffet. Go slow on your drinks as getting a server to refill it is next to impossible. When you walk in there are Zagat rated signs on the wall, with all due respect this place isn't worthy of being rated by Zagat. Your best bet is to stay on Boulder Highway and find someplace else to eat. One positive was the stir fry station manned by competent and friendly staff. It's the only thing that warrants a star.\n",

Definitely not worth the $35 dollars.  \\n\\nYay:\\n-Desserts: Cheesecake, gelato, rice pudding, carrot cake, and the strawberries (from the chocolate covered strawberries) were all the things I liked from this buffet.\\n-You have the option of paying $10 extra for champagne brunch which was nice.  \\n\\nNay:\\n-Food: why is everything so salty?!? I'm surprised no one is tasting the food before it comes out.  After I was done eating, my tongue felt sore from the abrasiveness of all the salty food.\\n-Variety: They don't have that many.  There was an abundance of pork though. Bacon, sausage (breakfast sausage and sausage patties, and andouille), roasted pork (Chinese 5 spice-skin was not crispy, Chinese pork ribs, and at the carving station-pork belly bacon was really tough and roasted pork ribs).  They had a small section of Asian food-everything was bleh or too salty, Spanish/Italian foods, a large breakfast station, a breakfast omelette station, a make your own cereal station, salad bar, dessert and the only soup being offered was a miso soup and guess what, yes that's salty as well. \\n-Carving station: I guess it's my fault for not asking about what was being served before I waited in line but there was NO prime rib!  I'm just so used to ALL the buffets in Vegas offering it, but this was a huge disappointment.  The only thing they had were roasted chicken, top sirloin, bone marrow and roast pig.  I liked that they had bone marrow BUT the toast that was served with it and the chimichurri was SALTY! UGH! It had like a strong garlic salt taste to it\\n-The guy at the carving station: was very inattentive.  Didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  A customer asked for a slice of prime rib and he gave him a slice of top sirloin.  Didn't even try to correct him and say that it wasn't prime rib.  Maybe he didn't hear him, but like I said, very inattentive.  I had to wave him down once because he was staring off somewhere else.\\n\\nI definitely regret coming here for brunch.\n",

The first trip me and my boyfriend ordered chili cheese fries which were huge, we both got plain hot dogs and topped them with the chili and cheese from the fries, there was more than enough! The place was only open a couple weeks and had a special where you could get a hot dog and beer for like $8 I think. The second trip they didn't have the hot dog and beer special so we were kind of disappointed. I would give them 5 stars if they brought back the hot dog/beer combo. Overall, great tasting dogs!\n",

This place just topped it off. My boyfriend and I chose it as our \\\"big spender\\\" meal of the weekend. To be honest, I do not remember the price but I know we spent more than 100$ on dinner for just the two of us. Please keep in mind this was my first time in montreal, my first time eating any sort of french food, and my first time ever eating escargot. The escargot was surprisingly good and was baked in a cheese and garlic mixture which I enjoyed very much. As for dinner, I barely remember since it was almost a year ago now, but I remember leaving thoroughly satisfied. We both got some kind of steak and we shared a bottle of wine. I wish my memory wasn't so hazy so I could provide more details, but I guess I'll just have to update this if/when I ever visit Montreal again.\n",

We do it every year.  This was perhaps, the wrong venue for us.  We did not have the solemn atmosphere that the memorial part of the event demands, and the other groups around us were having so much fun that I could barely hear the speaker.\\n\\nNo wait staff were required for our group, so I can't tell what service might be like as a regular diner.  Our meal was a buffet style bbq chicken dinner, which I probably would avoid if I could. It was a bit overdone, to the point where it may have been better to skip the chick half and make do with the beans (bland), corn (waterlogged cobbettes), rolls (good for crumbs, but not much else), and the afterthought salad.\\n\\nIf I didn't know that much of my fee was going to scholarships, I'd think that I got ripped off.\n",

I asked her if she knew that the prices on my bill were different than those on the website menu. She told me something that really didn't make sense. I replied that I thought they should charge me the prices from the website menu. She just gave me my change and didn't even say thank you (I guess the attitude started). I asked to speak with the manager, but she said he wasn't there. If it were my restaurant, I would have gladly matched the prices that were on the website menu, no questions asked or attitude given.

It was sexy, fun, entertaining and sure adult, just enough, perfect. So I took my husband for his birthday (dinner and a show in Vegas, nice ;-). We both left disappointed and with raging headaches. Where was the Cirque in this show? I saw drag, boobs, lewd jokes and minor acro feats. What I missed was the charm, the sensuality and awe that most Cirque shows offer in spades. You can see the aforementioned sexy XXX anywhere in Vegas. My advice to the consumer- decide what you want if it's raunch go elsewhere, if it's Cirque try O. To the Cirque team- try harder to stay on brand and revert back to the show as it was 10 years ago or take your name off this show. Zumanity is not worth the time or money, sorry.\n",

It seems like a nice salon. Kinda hard to find since its so off by itself. The parking lot was empty when I got there but I figure since it was evening no one might be getting their hair cut. Another customer was there and her hair was looking nice so I wasn't expecting this kind of experience.I got my hair cut by I'm guessing by a new hairstylist who was new out of beauty school. All I wanted was for my highlights to be done and a trim. I wanted my highlights to be a caramel color. Well after I was done sitting she washed the color out and when I saw my hair it was YELLOW! Not blonde or caramel like I wanted. YELLOW. I said it wasn't right so we went back with the toner. The owner walked in at the moment and was asked by the stylist what color of toner I needed. The owner then mixed it up after asking me what color I wanted my hair to be. After it was washed out it seemed ok. Not caramel still, but looked at the time to be ok. So we proceeded to the cut. I asked for just a trim. She did start cutting but she was just talking away and I was noticing that she was not cutting my layers at an angle like I've seen previous stylists do with cutting. She was Just cutting my layers straight. She asked if I would like my hair thinned out and I said yes. She pulled out a razor and began to hack away at my hair with it. I don't know much about hair cutting but I know when other stylists have thinned out my hair its with one of those special looking shears made for that. So after a 5 MINUTE \\\"trim\\\" she started to blowdry my hair which that didn't come out bad and I paid and left. So afterwards when I got home I started looking at my hair closer. I noticed that my hair looking almost an ORANGE color. I just washed it today and now I see the real damage that the woman did to me hair. It looks absolutely awful! The \\\"layer\\\" that she hacked away at my hair look just monsterous and the top \\\"layer\\\" is almost above my ear so I don't know how the heck I'm supposed to be able to find someone to fix it. I'm trying to grow it out and its so bad I have a feeling I well have to hack a lot of it off. Its so raggity looking now..and that orange color is bothering me even more.

While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \\nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.  Although I still like the frames, I'll get my lenses replaced elsewhere and make sure the customer service is better if I should have problems later!\n",

I have been there twice, one time with almost no one there and one time during pre-season football and both times, I thought I was invisible, which is a shame because the food is actually pretty good.  When I was there when it was SLOW, we were at a table and we weren't really sure why we were getting ignored so badly.  The second time, we sat at the bar and maybe the bartender thought the groups of guys would tip better than my bf and I because she didn't give us the time of day .... come to think of it, NONE of the bartenders gave us the time of day.  I had to resort to putting my empty bottles on the edge of the bar for them to notice me and that was the only time they even looked our way. \\n\\nIt's a shame too because like I said, the food is actually pretty decent.\n",

            "Review: I feel like I just finished a food marathon but not in a good way but in the way where you want to curl up in bed and forget about the whole experience.  A few friends and I spent 2 1/2 hours mostly waiting for a 3-course Pittsburgh Restaurant Week meal.  People, this is one portion of the 3 part meal every 50 minutes.  It was excruciating to say the least and while in the beginning (oh the first 1 1/2 hours) we attributed the extended wait times to the crowd coming for Restaurant week there seemed to be bigger issues at play, like for example the actual taste of the food or the general demeanor of our waitress (I think she hated us).\\n\\nIt should not take so long to cook sub-par food and in a customer driven environment you probably should be somewhat apologetic about the extended wait time...or maybe even preface the meal by saying, \\\"we're really busy tonight due to Restaurant week, we appreciate your patience as we prepare and bring out the food\\\" or even a \\\"hey, your food's going to take a long ass time, hope you didn't come in hungry\\\"...I don't know just say SOMETHING, ignoring the issue doesn't make it go away.\\n\\nI ordered the blackened tuna, caesar salad and porcini pasta off the Restaurant Week menu.  The only way to describe the blackened tuna was stiff...it didn't seemed overcooked but it was just like these crostini type pieces with little flavor...the gorgonzola cheese and sun-dried tomatoes helped but couldn't save this dish from itself.  I was ok with the caesar salad although my friends informed me that caesar salad shouldn't have tomatoes or olives both of which this salad had, including the token anchovy atop romaine lettuce.  The porcini pasta was decent...I wasn't blown away but felt that it could have used a little something something.  It had a creamy marsala sauce that was a bit sweet and tangy and the the pasta was cooked well as in al dente...it just wasn't doing anything for me.  But at this point in the meal (2 hours later) I'm not sure if there was any food dish that could've redeemed the whole experience.   \\n\\nWhy the generous 2 star rating you ask...I guess I'm hoping that the lackluster meal and service had more to do with Restaurant Week and that their regular menu on regular service days are much more pleasing.\n",

The laundry list of things that went wrong is mind boggling and too long to just be a coincidence. Keep in mind I went during the week (less busy) and they over charged us for using the refrigerator, pots and pans, the stove didn't work, bell hop showed up 3 hours after we check in, they don't provide hair dryers in rooms so we had to wait 2 hours for one, had two call them 5 times to clear up charges that were wrong, it costs money to use their refrigerator, had to wait 3 hours to check in, they charge your room a \\\"party fee\\\" if you bring booze over a certain limit on the bell hop cart (no other hotel does that). I was comp'd $300 and maybe you are thinking wow that's reasonable. I avidly go to Vegas and if that list of things happened at any other hotel a night or two would've been refunded (I've had that happened). \\n\\nHotel is beautiful yet you will have a headache the entire time from dealing with their shenanigans. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, they will tell you over phone check in is at 3 pm but check in isn't actually till 6 pm.

The chandelier plays a major part in several scenes, and where you sit is important. Sit under the chandelier if you can.\\n\\nAs we sat waiting for the opening number as others were being seated, I was approached by an usher who welcomed us as VIP ticket holders.

I was awestruck. The music, the production, the actors, the singing. I was absolutely converted into a fan, and my wife was on a whole different plane of nirvana. Everything about this show stopped our hearts (in a good way).\\n\\nAfter the show, we met the other dozen of VIP ticket holders and out guide.

We were very upset and was unable to talk to a manager till they next day who claims that they would give us a discount rate but wouldn't pay for the computer that they broke!\n",

            "Review: Best Brewpub in the United States.\\n\\nThis review applies to all four of the Madison area Great Danes - I've been to the original downtown location over 100x and have been to the other three locations 5-15x each, noticing minimal difference in quality of food, drink, or service.  Altogether, I figure I've eaten at the four Great Danes at least 150 times in the past 18 years and had only three less-than-top-notch experiences there (see below).  In fact, my wife and I love this brewpub so much that we rented out half of the downtown pub's outdoor garden area for our rehearsal dinner the evening prior to our wedding.\\n\\nMadison has a lot of great restaurants, but there are a few dishes that are hard to find here done properly, including Mexican and Chinese food in general, Buffalo wings, and nachos.  Well,  maybe the only place in Madison that actually has good nachos is the Great Dane, where they have lots of good toppings, lots of good cheese and will custom craft them to your particulars.  And their wings, while breaded and not the classic Buffalo-style, are quite tasty, if overpriced.  Their artichoke dip, served in very tasty dish made out of a hollowed-out fresh-baked loaf of bread, are the best I've ever had.  GD's soups are also very good and their onion soup, with melted cheese and croutons, will rival that of any restaurant, anywhere on earth; they use some of their beers in it and it is awesome.\\n\\nGD's hamburgers are among the 5 best burgers in Madison and I especially like their Dane Burger, which is topped with their awesome artichoke dip; I sometimes will ask for them to make me a Dane Burger with a healthier buffalo patty.  The Applewood Bacon Burger is also excellent, but not as good as the Vintage Brewing Company's similar Black-and-Blue Burger (the best burger in town).  The thick fries that accompany the burgers, among other side options, are outstanding when you dip them into GD's chipotle mayonnaise, \\n\\nMy favorite dish on the menu is the Southwest Tortellini, which is a cheese-filled spinach tortellini with blackened chicken, black bean salsa, and creamy cilantro sauce, served with a garlic bread that will shame 99% of garlic breads served by Italian restaurant.  The Inner Warmth Peanut Stew, a vegetarian dish, is flavorful, filling, spicy and excellent.  I heartily recommend the Thai Chicken Pizza, as well as the buffalo chicken pizza, when it is available.  I've always considered \\\"comfort food\\\" to be a lame affectation of the retro-trendy types, but GD's meat loaf is really good, its chicken pot pie is no longer a dish for one's grandparents, and its mac-and-cheese is extremely good, especially the buffalo chicken version.  I've had most of their salads and they are also top-notch, with very fresh lettuce and other ingredients.\\n\\nOK, as good as the Great Dane's food is, its beers are even better.  I'm a beer aficionado, have been to dozens of breweries around the US, and aside from a half dozen or so Belgian breweries (the Belgians brew the best beer in the world), I would be confident that the Great Dane's beers would compare more than favorably with the beers of the very best breweries anywhere.  The Old Glory APA (American pale ale - like an IPA but a bit lighter, with citrousy Cascade hops) is easily the best pale ale I've ever had.  The Crop Circle Wheat beer is one of the finest wheat beers made in the U.S.  If one were to ask beer experts to name the 5 best breweries in the U.S., Bell's, in Kalamazoo would make many of those lists.  Aside from their stouts (Bell's makes the finest stouts in the country, hands down), the Great Dane's beers are better across the board.  Bell's makes some mediocre beers; the Great Dane does not.\\n\\nI've had three less-than-positive experiences at the Great Dane.  Many years ago on Mardi Gras, they ran a drawing contest, I won a Great Dane golf shirt, but one of the owners had been giving me bad looks for no reason at all, he called over a bartender and had her tell me that I won a different prize, something trivial instead and took back the shirt.  I got so mad that the owner had been such a &*&%#@@ jerk that I didn't go back for months afterward.  This year I had mussels steamed in a beer garlic sauce and the mussels didn't taste fresh.  And for Mother's Day 2012 we went to their brunch buffet and were partially disappointed.  The omelet and carving stations were very good, but the pancakes, waffles, French toast, bacon and sausage had been made hours before and were not worth eating.\\n\\nSo why so many neg. reviews for GD?  I'm guessing some are bogus (I've had such uniformly positive experiences that I just don't believe some of the complaints) and I'm also guessing GD's owners refused to pay this site's AdBribery demand, so they get hit with more neg. reviews. Google the site's adpolicy if you don't believe me.\\n\\nIn summary, if there's a better brewpub in the US, I'd sure like to go there.  \\n\\nThe Great Dane is highly recommended.\n",

            "Review: This is one of my favorite places in downtown Chandler. Huge beer selection and they have a large menu of mixed beer drinks. The fish and chips are always a good choice and their cheese dip with pretzels is delish! I've had their wine burger as well and it was fantastic! We have always had great service that is prompt and friendly.\\n\\nMy only complaint is the smell. Another reviewer said \\\"mold maybe\\\"...no I would say urine. We have been there several times and sometimes you smell it and sometimes you don't. The last time we were there we were taken all the way to the back near the hallway to the bathroom and I asked to be moved due to the overwhelming odor. We moved more to the middle of the bar and although you could still smell it, it was less so, but I smelled it as soon as we walked in. It is an old building, but none of the other shops or restaurants have that odor. OWNERS: please have this fixed as I can see it driving people away.\n",

            "Review: Today at around 3:30 PM, i walked into this store where they were about 10 partons in the store. One of the clerks said \\\"Hi, hows it going today\\\", i said 'fine, but i'm about to get busy'. He notices my recently rescued puppy sitting in my car. He then yells out that he can see the heat rising over my dog's head, then this clerk says he (or someone) is going to break out my car windows\\\"??? I replied 'that i'm going to break you\\\" and some other words if he does that. By then i'm angry, or maybe embarrassed, since my car windows were down ...and i had a friend in the car with her, as well, and i'm only in that store for maybe 5 minutes. I'm angry because this is the 2nd time this clerk has made a comment that's pretty hostile about my dog, so this time i wanted to talk to him about how this makes me feel. The other clerk,  Robert Vassos, then begins to YELL at the top of his voice at me about wanting to address this clerk (all i said to that clerk was \\\"you hurt my feelings\\\") while he pushes him away, he's telling me to leave the store,, don't come back and a few other nasty words. I remained calm but i flipped him off and licked my tongue out at him (i know, very childish) with a smile on my face as i exited the store, not sure what else i said before that moment. He thens runs behind me yelling out the door \\\"screw you and your dog!!\\\"??  I flipped him off again, something i NEVER, EVER do, even in traffic, or at anyone, for that matter but i needed to fight back at this point since both of them had become hostile towards me by then??\\n\\n I'm a 4th generation Nevadan Grandpa worked on Boulder Dam, my dad owned packaged liquors in the Midwest after his years as a professional football player. I've never seen such crazy hostile reactions being it was their clerk that started this with me by making threats about vandalizing my car when i walked into their store? The reasons i became so concerned now was that the other many patrons might decide to attack me or my car, thinking i was doing what he had accused me of doing to my puppy?? I'm a hybrid driving vegan that lives a sustainable lifestyle but i dont run around in grocery stores YELLING at customers because they choose to eat meat or drive gas guzzling cars,, yet this clerk is yelling at me about my furrychild based on paranoid delusions?? \\n\\n In the past, all the other clerks have been extremely nice but this clerk needs reevaluation and should keep his hostile, paranoid thoughts to himself; that manager needs anger management before he hurts someone. thank you!\n",

            "Review: This place looks like it should get four or five stars. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver a four or five star experience.\\n\\nWe went there on a Sunday for lunch. We walked in and just managed to get in the door. There were several people in front of us waiting for a table. The hostess seated everyone fairly quick. We were taken to be seated at a table, but doing so would have put us shoulder-to-shoulder and elbow-to-elbow with the people at the tables next to us. The inside, at least for me, felt claustrophobic. (I don't think I've been anywhere that felt this way before.) We decided instead to sit at the bar.\\n\\nWe took a seat at the bar. The bar is small. Maybe a little bigger than what someone might have in their home. We were promptly greeted by the bartender. She took our drink order and gave us a quick run down of how to get our food. There is a menu  but you have to go to almost the last page to get bowl sizes and price.\\n\\nYou have a couple options to get your food. One is to fill out a small card with your name, bowl size and if you want noodles, rice or cabbage added to what you already put in your bowl. This you take with you, get in line, fill your bowl with your choices and present it at the end to the cooks. Or, you can fill out a larger card that lists all your options for ingredients, check off what you want and hand it to your server to take up for you. As a third option, there are twelve dishes listed with ingredients if you prefer to not have to wing it.\\n\\nWe decided to make our own. Line was short and moved quickly. First station you pick your meat. Although shrimp is still on the menu, they are no longer serving it due to cost. I picked the lime garlic fish instead. Next is seasoning, after that veggies and last is sauces. You can also add an egg at the end. Then mark if you want noodles, rice or cabbage and off it goes to be cooked. There are a lot of choices. It's a bit overwhelming at first. \\n\\nWe went back and sat down. Our food was done fairly quick. The food looked good, but somehow I think my fish got lost. At first I thought it may have flaked apart, but I never even found flakes of it. Quite disappointing! First no shrimp, even though still on the menu, and then my fish was completely left out.\\n\\nBy the time we finished, the line for a bowl had become increasingly longer. The odd thing is that the line itself cuts right through the middle of the restaurant and towards the front door, further lending to the small claustrophobic feel. \\n\\nService was good, food just okay, atmosphere was close and too small.\\n\\nTwo stars.\n",

It was hard to move, and if you danced, it would get so hot immediately that you would sweat. The cover charge was $20 and the drinks were expensive. I ended up spending $70 on just drinks alone. The decor is asian of course, but it seemed to be trying too hard. I believe it was a blatant disrespect for using religious icons for decor for a nightclub. I wouldn't do the same thing with Christianity for a nightclub.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line for the men's restroom was awfully long abutting against the side bar which was extremely crowded also. The music was mixed from rock, oldies, dance, and some hip hop to please the masses.

We had to wait for a while for our food, but that was good news to us=ignore the whiners who demand the food fast. It meant that they were cooking everything from scratch. It's important that chefs invest their time and love in their food, and it reflected through my first \\\"ahh, this is heavenly\\\" bite of the burrito. I'm so happy I found this place!! I plan on buying their El Sol salsa. Always follow the traditional mexican bakery-guaranteed you will get authentic mexican dish.

The accommodations are okay, the casino is alright, and the eateries are pleasant. \\n\\nHere's the big HOWEVER: \\n\\nIF YOU EVER LEAVE YOUR BAGGAGE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES OR IN THE BELL HOP AREA, LOCK YOUR BAGS!! \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I vacationed there May 1-3, and when we checked out, our baggage went to bell hop because our flight wasn't leaving for another 12 hours. \\n\\nWhen we got back home in Honolulu, we found some personal items (brand spanking new!!) MISSING!! \\n\\nI called the hotel and TWO weeks later, they are still giving me the run around about how to go about filing this complaint. Initially, they allowed me to file a complaint and i got a report number. Then they said call the RISK MANAGEMENT office (which I don't think exists!!) to follow up. I have called the office EVERY SINGLE day and EVERY SINGLE time it goes to voice mail, saying they are busy or away from the desk. They must be playing all day cause cant get them to answer ONCE. When I brought this up to a manager (about how i cannot get a hold of the RISK MANAGEMENT), they said \\\"oh, they must be backed up.\\\" WAIT. That's the last thing I want to hear: That they have SO MANY report complaints that they re backed up. WTH. \\n\\nSo, I call front desk, and i end up talking to several different managers saying they'll get back to me. THEY NEVER DID. I asked to be connected to an actual speaking person from the Risk Management office, and the managers say they cant connect me (How sketchy is this?!) Then just recently, the manager said they don't even have my report number. THAT WAS IT: I'VE HAD IT UP TO **HERE**. \\n\\nIts very frustrating because as paying guests, we should get the treatment and respect, and so far, the only thing I've walked away with is that THE ENTIRE CORPORATION DOESN'T CARE. They haven't called me back since, they haven't offered to take care of some of the expenses. \\n\\nI wanted to share this HORRIBLE experience over yelp because I don't think anyone else should have to experience this. \\n\\nBy the way, if you ask to speak to a manager, don't even bother (I'd put their name on here, but I don't do threats).

Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and d\\u00e9cor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'\\n\\nNot exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.\n",

            "Review: Centennial Toyota has been our go to spot for car shopping for years. My family got a total of four cars from them (one lease) and while the salespeople are usually polite and not very pushy, the price you get might not be great and the service for the few visits i personally had were pretty horrendous.\\n\\nMy recent experience at Toyota was less than pleasant though. It was a big waste of time. I convinced my girlfriend and her sister to check out centennial toyota simply because my history with them and naturally i expected a rather fantastic quote from them. I did my research and called several dealership as well as printed the true price paper from U.S news cars website, I even had a friend who sent me their receipt from Henderson toyota for the exactly the same car. \\n\\nI started off by letting my gf test drive the car and then the scary negotiation begins. The salesperson was very polite but let me say my previous purchase and my loyalty played absolutely no part in the negotiation process. I was quoted $3000 more than the true car pricing gotten off of the cars website and about $3500 more than what our friend got at Henderson. What bothers me the most is that the salesperson kept asking for my bottom line. It's safe to say that he missed the point, he was playing the bargaining game with me and I just wanted a hassle-free experience. After we told him we will visit another dealership and my gf's mom has to co-sign with her on the car even if we buy it right now, he looked dismayed and became obviously less excited about us. He somewhat hastily ended the conversation and gave us a not so great price written on the back of his business card and we left very unsatisfied. He never mentioned anything about the $25 test drive gift card btw even though I showed him the coupon that they sent us. The whole thing took almost two hours.\\n\\nWe went straight to fletcher jones afterward, and guess what, we bought our car there the same day. Their initial offer and the only offer for the same car beats the Centennial quote by around $4000 and the recent graduate discount was $750 vs. $500 from centennial. Yes, the cars were exactly the same with door protector being the only difference. We had NO negotiation because we felt the price was great and all of us were surprised how easy it was. With signing and everything it took about 3 hours total. \\n\\nCentennial later sent me an email after I told them my disappointment. The manager simply told me that I should've just called them and that they will not be beaten by any body on price. That's completely missing the point. If they offered me a good price and played no bargaining game with me in the first place, I would probably spent a little more to save the trouble. It's safe to say my loyalty with this place is completely gone. \\n\\nWill I go back to Centennial Toyota? Probably, since buying a car is all about playing these games. I am not sure if buying at Fletcher Jones can as easy as this one. But will I ever convince somebody to go to Centennial simply because my so called \\\"Loyalty\\\", absolutely not. There is no loyalty, at least not with what happened to me.\n",

We are pretty much novices to this style of asian cuisine but here is what we go and our impressions:\\n\\nPork Belly Sliders - well when I think of sliders I expect them to be really small. The portion was pretty big the issue was we just did not like the spices used to flavor it. It may be just something that you have to like to appreciate - for instance, I really just am not a fan of cilantro and there was a good bit of it on there as well as other spices we did not care for. \\n\\nWonton dry Noodles - Like others have mentioned - I was expecting a lot more noodle options - perhaps they will be expanding the option but you stick the word noodles in the name of your place and I expect to see more than four options. That said, this was the best thing we ate. The noodles were lovely and I loved the wonton dumplings. I was actually thinking about them the next day and really cannot wait to go back and get more!\\n\\nScallion pancakes - I have had these at a number of places and really love them. These were not my favorite. In fact, I prefer the ones across the street at rose tree cafe. My husband, however, really enjoyed them. \\n\\nWould I go back? totally and plan to!\n",

            "Review: Stop. I like this place. I don't want to hear that this place is some generic watered down Japanese food restaurant or something.  I don't think this place was made to be authentic.  It's catering to a broader audience or to first timers who want to get their feet wet with some Asian food, or people who  just want that quick Asian food fix  without the full menu experience  I've had the chicken, beef, pork, and katsu plates. Their house dressing for their salad is unique like a sweet vinegerette. Their gyoza and shrimp tempura is just like what you'll find in any Japanese restaurant.  The food is flavorful and made from scratch and made to order. Sizable portions that are satisfyijng to your belly. Service is quick and courteous. It's great fast food without the grease and the short order cook with a spatula banging on the bell yelling \\\"Order up!\\\"\n",

I love shops with that neighborhoody feel. He knew everyone who came in to pick their orders up, and is really easy to chat with. If I was rating Fazio's on customer service it would be 5 easily, but the food is delicious, too!\\n\\nWe've only had their cheese pizza and chicken parm hoagie, but both were excellent. The pizza crust is really thin, and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese. As other reviewers stated, if you want a traditional, greasy pie, this is one of the best places to sate your craving in Pittsburgh. Despite the thin crust, it's never been undercooked and soggy, and we haven't had to deal with a burnt crust, either. As for the hoagie...their rolls are delicious and really help make the sandwich. I can't wait to try some of their other hoagies, but for now, the chicken parm might be hard to pass up for me.\\n\\nOverall, Fazio's is the complete package for a pizza shop. Great customer service, a neighborhood vibe, and delicious, reasonably-priced food. You really can't' go wrong! Enjoy!\n",

They have decent drink prices as I scored a domestic draft for 2 bucks. They have a bunch of food choices as well for between $3 and $5 depending on the time. It was a bit of surprise that they do not offer white meat chicken for the tacos, only mixed. That tells me that this place is saving money and I'm not buying the bartenders \\\"it keeps it moist excuse\\\" Menu prices are right out of Scottsdale, but the free chips and salsa were good. Chips were kinda warm and salsa was chunky variety with some onions floating in the bowl. Too small of a bar area for a good happy hour crowd, so this place won't need to be revisited.\n",

Though the club offers a MUCH better place to be then in any terminal - once inside I really expected more. It was a huge place with tid bits of food here and there, but nothing like I thought there should be. Cheese that didn't taste too good, soup with too many noodles and endless amounts of chairs without a place for your lap top. I was naive to think that you might get free drinks, but not even soda was free! In my opinion they could have done so much more with the space. \\n\\nThe restrooms were clean enough - cleaner then the ones in the terminal and the entire lounge was much less noisy, but the cost is a bit high! \\n\\nI will be checking out the other airports to see how their clubs compare, but I'm hoping for a cheaper way without being a Chairman! \\n\\nI was more impressed by the Delta Club!\n",

            "Review: Still a fan here!  Shop Cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for Taco Night at our house!  This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\\n\\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\\n\\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\\n\\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\\n\\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?  Often with a free drink?  I'm there!  I enjoy most of the fare at Cardenas, and it's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal.  As of late, they have taken out the sliced cucumbers and sliced radishes that used to be regulars at the bar...but it's ok.  They probably had to because of food cost, or because of people like me who love to stock up for some healthy snacking!  No problem though, looks like more pickled jalapenos for me!  I am probably there for food at least 5-6 times a month.  I love me a torta with a mix of tomatillo salsa and Cardenas hot sauce for dipping.  MUY DELICIOSO!\\n\\nCheap and easy, that's my motto.  Well, for grocery shopping at least.  Cardenas fits that nicely.  If you see me there, come by and say \\\"Hola!\\\"  I might just be able to understand you.\n",

Was given soy sauce/glowing red over processed sweet and sour sauce with my food instead. Macaroni in the salad was over cooked and mushy with some type of seasoning that looked like pepper. It was also runny using a low quality mayo and missing the sprinkles of carrot shavings that I'm so used to in a good Hawaiian macaroni salad. The barbecue chicken was dry and could not taste any of the marinade it was supposed to be cooked in. The bed of vegetables was old dry cabbage resembling the fake grass you see in an easter basket. This menu was confused if it should have been hawaiian barbecue or ghetto chinese food of south phoenix. The elderly Asian couple was very friendly and service was quick which should be expected being the only customer in there. The place was clean compared to the next closest one in Avondale. Location is among a lot of other fast food places and can easily be overlooked.

To my disappointment, all of their drinks tasted like heavy syrup in each one. We got Strawberry Lemonade, Peach Iced Tea, and Homeade Root Beer. All of them were vigorously stirred and still tasted way too sweet. We ordered Tapas for appetizers. You can never really go wrong with Olive Tapenade and that's what I stuck with. It was good. For food, there was steak tacos, some flatbread stuff?, and veggie pizza. According to my friend, steak tacos were meh. Flatbread had no flavor. Veggie pizza was decent.

Panda express would be an improvement over this place. The bill was 130 for one person for lunch. Of course i had leftovers to take to pops but I felt like he might feel as though I was trying to poison him. I ordered the cantonese pot stickers to start. You could do better in the frozen section at costco. Next up I opted for the upgraded beef dish which is served table side on a sizzling platter it was like pepper beef sirloin or something like that. Really boring dish no imagination. was funny when i was ordering the waiter suggests i upgrade even further to kobe beef,I said well you probably wont get the benefit if its covered in a sauce,he says I will,even though i had a 200 comp and would not have had to pay for it I didn't do it. I asked him how much would it cost ,he says let me look on the menu,after we look together he cant find it he estimates it to cost around 90 dollars,like i said it would have been comped but it seemed too egregious to me. Next I ordered the sweet and sour chicken,total crap again you could do much better at panda express or costco. And lastly I ordered a bbq pork and shrimp combo fried rice,this was the best dish of all and I suspect that it is served regularly at the CCDC on fried crap night. In conclusion im glad i had  the comp but i still had to tip for 20 bucks ,its not the servers fault so i always take care of them. The server was very nice actually. Steve must be losing his taste as well as his vision because anyone who would rate this anything but touristy garbage food is on the payroll.\n",

Only complaint - the beet salad was very LIGHT on beets - but they were fantastic.  I could have done without the cabbage piece of it - very nondescript - but the beets were fantastic.  Also, we were celebrating a birthday and brought a bottle of wine as a gift - not to share at the meal, but as a gift.  We weren't allowed to bring it in - I'm hoping it was liquor laws that forbade it.  If we had it in a bag or wrapped - it wouldn't have been a problem.  interesting.  But overall - a great meal!

Several minutes later after I had received my thimble size glass of wine for $9.50, another couple came in who had no reservations--yet were seated at a table in the relatively open restaurant.

There is nothing like a true Wood-fire oven for Pizza, and Magpie has one.   I chose the margarita pizza with added anchovies and a handful of rocket greens on top.  the pizza was good but the crust was not quite as good as what I found at Bottega - in little Italy.  The hipster setting of Mile End is what it is and the staff were nice. For me still, the best real- Italian pizza experience is at  Bottega. I find them to be the winner.  Value for Money was not there with Magpie.  Wine / cocktails were way over priced for what you get, however the mixed cocktails were well put together.\n",

Best waffle Ive ever had.  I always felt something missing from all the waffles Ive done before, but now I know the lasting brown crisp was what I have been missing because something needs to stand up to syrup.

Our drinks were fantastic, and the seafood was heavenly. My party finished off the meal with Irish coffees, and they were so strong (whiskey wise) that he had to warn us as he set them down.

To put it into context, I have watched totem, zumanity, ka, and Zarkana and this show blows all of them out of the water!\\n\\nThis theater definitely has one of the nicest lobbies and I really recommend you take photos here before the show starts because it gets crazy packed. The theater itself is small and intimate, I highly recommend the areas that are right across from the screens because they really set the mood. Also, every chair has a built in speaker so the music you hear is crisp to perfection.\\n\\nI was moved by every single act. From the moment I heard the iconic string strum in A hard day's night, I was hooked! I have to admit, being a huge beatles fan really helps because you can immerse yourself in the lyrics and the recognize the time period undertones. The show is very deep compared to the other shows and it tackles racism, the berlin wall, heart breaks, and world war 2. It's not the most acrobatic or jaw dropping show rather it's the most immersive show. \\n\\nIn order to not reveal spoilers, some of my favorite acts were Lucy in the sky, black bird, Something and Hey Jude. This show is a visual and audio overload, so much going on the stage at a time! Basically, I was grinning ear to ear through out the whole show. I had a really hard time getting beatlemania out of my head. :).\\n\\nOverall, hands down the best Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever watched!\n",

They really had a chance to get off to good start during Spring Training but as others have noted here, the service we got was pretty bad and in my opinion food was average and overpriced. $11 for a burger and frozen tater tots. $2 Dos Equis during March Madness balanced it out a bit on our visit. Although we had several issues with our waitress and her apparent indifference towards her job, our lasting impression is waitresses standing around texting/staring at their phones in the entry to the kitchen while we waited for ice tea and water refills. Unfortunately we were not the only table being ignored as several others were not real thrilled either. Topping it off was a table of 5 who had just come from a game that night - they waited about 5 minutes, no one came over to take care of them so they left.\\n\\nIf you're going to put the money into opening a place like this, invest in people who can make it successful.

The chefs are working extremely hard right in front of you and they have many interesting things on the menu. We had appetizers of the duck confit and some sort of sashimi. The duck confit was great and had some really fun elements, like the huckleberry waffle(?) first for me. The sashimi  special was awesome as well. we also received a small sample of a duck mousse,tasted like tuna and mayo, which was alright and some cauliflower soup, yum! I had the duo of Berkshire Pork, which was highly recommended by the waiter. It was good in an artsy sort of way, but I wasn't completely blown away. It said it came with brussel sprouts, but it was really 3 leaves of brussel sprouts, haha funny. The pork chop wasn't so great, apples added depth though, and the pork belly I didn't care for. The demi was good though. The donuts for dessert were pretty good as well. I liked the dulce de leche dip. They gave us some homemade shortbread to take home, very good. The service was wonderful. I did wait at the bar and was suggested a very nice sauv by the bartender. The place is so tiny, reservations are a must, we had to sit outside, but it was a lovely night. I wish this place had some great view overlooking the city instead of the grocery store parking lot. Managers did come up frequently to check on us and gave some insight and great suggestions.

Salad was good, but nothing special. Ranch dressing was really good, bleu cheese dressing was really bad. Chicken tenders were burnt, like to the point that when I opened the container, it smelled like a kitchen was on fire. They were so black, I could not believe that they actually delivered those to us. The buffalo sauce was good, but useless since our chicken was not eatible. The baked potato fries were a good concept and had a good flavor, but the fries were soggy, but maybe that was just because they were delivered. Okay, maybe it was less than a 50/50 ratio here, since we did spend over $100 for so much dissapointment.\n",

This place is off the strip and u cant walk to the strip kuz its jus too far. There's a lil coffee shop that sells some finger foods and snacks. But i suggest u not buy anything from there kuz its pricey as hell! A lil red bull was $4.32. I heard thats the price as the bigger red bull can when u get them at the regular store. but  u know hotels be taxin' up the ying yang! \\n\\nOk so lemme describe the room. My room lookd jus like the picture thats loaded under the pictures. It had a lil flat screen on the desk, but channels they had sucked. Really had nothin to watch, but who's spose to watch TV in vegas anyways right!?! I didnt have a great view but im ok with that. View of the parking lot was good enuff for me! Bed was nice and clean. The bathroom was a good size. It had a stand up shower and a lil bath tub. \\n\\nOverall, it was a very nice room! And yes I would stay here again!\n",

The drinks are well prepared but have no real zing and if you order food... it's at your own peril. The food, if I can call it such a thing, is your typical bar food, nachos, quesadillas and wings. As with most bar food, you need to be properly alcoholised in order to mildly enjoy it. It's drunk food, drunk enough to consume anything. \\n\\nThe pool tables are well maintained, so are the sticks (from what I saw). The place is group-ready but not my cup of tea. It was perfect for our last minute happy hour party but it's a dive and I say dive with its negative connotation.\n",

Their runners don't time the food right and even the waiter/waitress that waits on you doesn't even remember who ordered what. They call this place an American brasserie but this is fake French at best, and even that is a bit of an insult if you'd ask a French chef to taste their food. Don't get me wrong.  The food here is good, but thats the problem - It's not 'excellent' , 'mouthwatering' or 'to die for'. It's just ok good.  It's not worth what they charge, and if you're looking for good French, this place definitely isn't it.  With that being said, the ambiance and decor are superb. The mixed drinks are tasty and they don't jip you on the alcohol.  I suppose I expected a lot more out of a restaurant in the upscale Renaissance Hotel near the theatres, where a lot of out-of-towers may frequent. Surely, you wouldn't want this place to showcase Pittsburgh.\n",

To start off there was little to no wait which was great. The hostess staff is pretty rude and not very helpful at all!I was in a party of 10, we asked for a table that was open closer to the buffet and she said no because she was going in line to who got there and we were not first. Well um you were seating us right then so yes I would say we were first! Carrying on..\\n\\nWhen I got up to the buffet I was amazed by how much stuff was there. My first choice was the blackened salmon. HUGE MISTAKE as it was pretty raw! It was terrible!! I grabbed a few other items that were pretty sub par too. The sushi was also warm and tasted terrible!! After almost gagging on that plate I figured I would hit up the crab and shrimp. First piece of crab I grabbed was covered in curly hair! Now I know this crab did not get a Jerry curl after being killed so someone forgot their hairnet! YUCK YUCK YUCK!! the other pieces I took were rubbery and tasted pretty bad. Shrimp was OK. Prime rib was my next stop after. I was hoping to say something good about that but with the salt content on  it I just can't :( There was really not a whole lot I can say I enjoyed here. I left feeling gross and mad that I had paid well over $100 bucks for this crap!! I tried to speak to a manager but the hostess told me to get over it and leave. I did not even have a chance!! When I tried to explain that I was feeling sick and that my friend got up several times during our meal to get sick she told me to stop whining and leave already! I have worked in hotels and as a hostess at a buffet before and have never in my life would i ever dream of talking to someone like that!! \\n\\nTerrible just Terrible!

            "Review: Alexander Michael's is a hidden gem in the 4th Ward.  It's rare to see restaurants uptown remain open for 27 years, but you'll quickly find out why.  Its a pub with the charm of the Cheers bar (in a converted 100 yr. old house) and food that cannot be called \\\"grub\\\".\\n\\nI visited last week and felt immediately welcome in this cozy tavern. Despite the busyness of that night, we were served promptly  The server was quite friendly; she offered suggestions of her fav dishes and the most commonly ordered ones.  After seeing the positive reviews for the London Broil sandwich, I opted for this sandwich with onion rings.  .   The London Broil sandwich was moist and bursting with flavor, like it was slow cooked.  The onion rings tasted homemade.  My friend ordered the copious bread pudding dessert and found it quite tasty as it was covered in caramel sauce.\\n\\nI think Alexander Michael's exudes \\\"chill\\\" and this is what is so attractive about it.  The clientele was young and old; it neither felt like a country club or a college sports bar.  The TV's (though they show sporting events) don't distract from conversation like most sports bars and though there is a bar, I didn't see folks getting hammered on well drinks and PBR.  Great place to bring friends of all ages and family if they are visiting Charlotte.\n",

            "Review: This place, is one of those hidden jewels. There are some ups and downs. But the fact that we were there to eat, the food was very pleasing. \\n\\nOn the corner of Craig and Lamb, also being next to a gas station, it stuck out with its big JUKE JOINT sign. We were looking for something new, something different and end up at Juke Joint. The outside look clean and going their a tad bit after 1pm, we notice that it did seem to be busy. We were kind of surprise in a way, that  they separated the bar and the restaurant. Usually going to a bar and grill, the bar is smack dab in the middle. But in this case, it was in separate rooms. Which was very interesting and I kind of like it. It was connected by doorways, but minimizing the connection from loud music and dining area, was enjoyable. You can still hear the loud music, but its not blowing out your ear drums, as if you were in the bar. Plus, the variety of music they have was pleasing. \\n\\nSince majority of the customers were in the bar area, we basically had a lot of options to sit in the dining area. It was spacious, for us to move around and relax. The scenery, was very settled, nothing really stuck out, except the big TV and a sign for Karaoke. \\n\\nWe were greeted by a nice elderly lady, that knew our waitress was on the other side, in the bar room. So she was kind enough to give us a menu and go over the weekend specials. We were amaze on the pricing, for the food they were serving. A 10oz New York Steak, side of vegetable (mine was corn) and a choice of mash potato, bake potato and other choices ( I chose the baked Potato), all for $5.99, then of course I'll get it. I think the wife got a double cheeseburger special, which was $4.99 and it was more then she can handle. But we did start with some Nachos with chicken, and that was amazing. I wish I could of taken it home that day and save it for later. \\n\\nI don't want to forget the waitress we had, she was funny. I like the fact that she was able to entertain us and make sure we were okay. Even though she had to go back and forth to the restaurant and bar. That right there is a very dedicated waitress, who would go beyond her duty, to make sure her customers are satisfied. \\n\\nAnother place, that I highly recommend to try. The food was great, the staff was very nice and the waitress we had was awesome. The pricing varies, but its affordable. Take advantage of the weekend specials, cause I believe they're worth it., Go during the slow times, mainly after 12, cause I'm sure you'll enjoy it more. If we had room for dessert, then I'm sure we would highly recommend it too. But we were so full, I just wanted to go home and sleep. For a place that's so far away from the norm, its a spot that you would really enjoy, at least we did.\n",

She also didn't badmouth other tanning salons, which unfortunately happens quite a bit around LV,\\n\\nI've been here 5 or 6 times since, and I am in love with the beds.  They are high quality and I haven't burned at all, super clean and I love that they talk to you and tell you to have a good day or whatever when you're done tanning:)  The stand up bed is the best I've ever used...even better than the salon down the street who advertised stand up beds only - plus SST's beds are ten times cleaner.\\n\\nThe owners are SOUTHERN...woohoo from Texas, so that makes them kindred spirits in my book.  I love finding fellow Southerners who relocate to Vegas, makes me feel more at home!  They really care about their business and about making customers happy and helping them tan safely.  There's a blonde girl who works there and she's super nice too.  \\n\\nI enjoy tanning here a LOT and I truly hope this business has great success!\n",

            "Review: This place gets brownie points in my book for being open during the wee hours of the night. This place would normally be an average 3-4 star rating but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that its open 24 hours, it's located off Spring Mountain and Valley View (relatively close to the strip, making it convenient for late night eats for locals getting off work or after a night of clubbing or gambling). \\n\\nWhat I also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is FAST! After sitting down and ordering, I'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!\\n\\nI always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty. Then I enjoy ordering the Mongolian beef or the Bun bo hue; a vermicelli noodle soupy have good pho according to my Vietnamese friends who always order that but I usually don't get it because I'm not in the mood for soup and the bun is basically the same ingredients without the broth.\n",

The soups in particular just warm you up inside. \\n\\nPad thai here is also exceptional and come with plenty of meat.\\n\\nI ordered catering here for a large party and it was incredibly competitive pricing plus they delivered the order such a convenience.\\n\\nGreat place to bring people great date place too the decor is very nice and there is a great drink/happy hour menu. While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages. \\n\\nReally cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD. Even some dishes when ordered mild will have a kick and medium to hot dishes can have quite the lingering burn, but I could just be a wuss. Order the sweet ice tea in case and the spice won't be a problem you can't handle.\n",

I get it, it's Veteran's Day, but it's not that like thats news - couldn't you have cancelled in advance?  I would have come another time.  There was an entire section of the restaurant that was closed, and yet you cancel? Annoying. We sat in the bar because trivia is held there (starting at 8) and the service left much to be desired.  Especially when I am eating Mango Habanero wings (holy mama! Tasty but super sneaky hot), I NEED my iced tea glass to stay full.

But the sandwich as a whole, was unappetizing, and didn't have the fresh, crispness that I've come to expect from Capriotti's, Jimmy John's or hell, even Quiznos. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor. If you are in need of a stellar sandwich, and nothing is in sight, PLEASE go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market and pickup your own ingredients.

            "Review: I don't expect a fancy parade of amazing service, offerings of exotic produce or a team of personal shoppers fawning over me when I go to the grocery store. Given that grocery shopping is already the bane of my life, I have really low expectations for the place where I purchase my impressive assortment of top ramen food products.\\n\\nSeriously, I'm not shopping for organic baby prawn medleys and goose liver patte'... I just want to get in and purchase my run of the mill poor person foods like canned beans and frozen dinners. So when I say low expectations, I mean REALLY low expectations.\\n\\nSo it really says something about the Smith's that I would rather saw off my own foot than shop for my failure cuisine at their grocery store. \\n\\nWhen someone that has been beaten by the poverty police and kicked in the face by life as much as I have doesn't want to shop at your store no matter how great your prices are, you have got some problems. I don't actually notice that the prices are much different than any other store in the area, though. \\n\\nTo be fair, I may not be noticing prices because of the instant seizure caused by walking into the herd of people always grazing around in the Smith's. The prices seem to be the same overinflated prices seen everywhere else in Las Vegas. Same high prices, same fake discounts.\\n\\nThe parking lot at the Smith's is absolutely insufferable. It's like parking at Walmart, but without the option to park really far away in hopes that your car won't be needlessly assaulted. You can always count on Smith's to give you that uneasy sensation you get when leaving your car in a suspicious lot. Any sense of relief you feel when finding your car unscathed at the end of the shopping trip will quickly subside when you try to leave and a number of cars pass behind you, almost collide with you, get in your way and speed. \\n\\nDespite the anger and road rage you will feel in the Smith's parking lot, I think you can really count yourself lucky that none of these citizens of our fair city ran you over as a pedestrian.\\n\\nWhen you get inside the store you might actually just have a panic attack and die. I always hope that is what will happen to me when I see that battlefield. To say that Smith's has an overcrowding problem is a laughable understatement. Smith's makes every day feel like Black Friday: You will bump into other people, wait in line to look at things and have trouble navigating the store through all that human garbage. I guess that is not too bad when you think about the hand-to-hand combat that could ensue should Smith's ever hold true to the Black Friday tradition and place an item on sale. (They are keeping us safe.) \\n\\nBring your hand  sanitizer for all the awesome contact with humanity you'll be having at the Smith's!\\n\\nI think the owner must be friends with the fire marshall because there is no way that place isn't over capacity at any given time. If it weren't for all the food in there I'd say it was like a third world country. Except, I guess third world countries do have food but no one can afford it. So it is pretty similar to a third world country. Without the charm.\\n\\nI guess it is not fair to hold the business responsible for the fact that so many people descend on the store like the apocalypse is upon us. However, I can and do blame them for not staffing the store properly and relying almost exclusively on self-checkout. This causes all those people to become trapped in the store and creates a feeling desperation and taints the air with the smell of sweat. It also fills my heart with hate.\\n\\nThere is always a huge line of frustrated people clogging up the isle in the front of the store. There is only one isle with a person checking and it's always crammed, so people start to self-checkout with way too many items or when they are way too stupid to operate the sophisticated check out equipment. I hope the person who thought of self-checkout was put to death for his crime against humanity.\\n\\nOnce you are able to get to the front of the line, expect to get held up at least once because even of you are not purchasing alcohol the bagging area is very weight sensitive. In fact, Smith's is so concerned that you are going to steal from them that they force you to wait for an attendant because you dropped a ten cent packet of Koolaide. Then you have to wait for an eternity because Smith's has left the same person in charge of 8-10 stations and there are clearly a ton of people who should not be using self checkout to begin with.\\n\\nLook, I'm not classy, I don't have any pride, I'm shopping at Smith's for crying out loud! Grocery shopping is a horrible chore and I hate it with a passion. Unfortunately Smith's makes a chore feel like a war. I shouldn't have to take a nap afterwards.\n",

            "Review: my first Burberry purchase was on 5\\\\29/2014 I mistakenly purchased a ll maydown MCO Bla46 which was on sale for $595 formerly $750. It was cute with two tassels in front with a snap button closure. I was told by the sales person that I needed to take the purse on the floor because they were no others. After getting home I immediately took the tags off of a purse. After filling the purse with various items I noticed that the latch was hard to secure. After leaving Las Vegas I went to San Francisco and left a purse in Las Vegas at a family member's house on my return to Las Vegas on June 24th 2014. I decided that I would return the purse due to the problems with the closure. When I attempted to return the purse to the store for my  full refund I was told that's because the purse with on sale I only had 14 days for a refund additionally I was told that the purse was not in resalable condition due to the fact that the price tag had been removed. After talking to managers and Customer service it was determined that the store was in fact justified in their decision to refuse a refund or store credit for the purse. I feel that if i had I known that the purse and had a 14 day return policy I might have not purchases a sale item.\\n I would have never taken the tag off immediately until I was sure that the bag was fully functional. I feel it you can get better service at Walmart you have 30 day return policy and all you really need is a receipt I'm sure Louis Vuitton does not have such a shallow policy. Burberry can never match\\n up to louis Vuitton and maybe this is one of the reasons why you live and you learn.\\n\\n..\\n.\n",

            "Review: My Mom and I stopped in for lunch last week, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, at a little before noon. We were seated right away, the restaurant wasn't busy.  Iced teas were served in average time.  I ordered the TAB (turkey, avocado, bacon) sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My Mom wanted to order the half sandwich/salad option.  She wanted the same TAB sandwich and one of their salad items, a strawberry something salad.  She was told that the only salad options were a garden or ceasar salad, so she opted for a garden salad.  It took easily 30 mins for the order to arrive.  \\n\\nIn the meantime, the restaurant started to fill and it became obvious there were only two servers working the entire south side of the restaurant.  The order arrived and my mother's order was wrong.  She was given a full sandwich with a side salad which, once we got the bill, we realized the waitress got wrong and did a salad substitution instead of the other sandwich side options which added almost $2 to the bill.  Given that the waitress pointed out the half sandwich options, not sure why the order wasn't correct.  She was completely unavailable to straighten it out.  For a sandwich that is named with avocado sharing the spotlight with turkey and bacon, it isn't unthinkable to expect a few actual slices of avocado in there.  Both sandwiches had so little avocado, I had to take a pic and include it with the review.  The bread was average whole wheat bread.  A better quality of bread could have really upped that game.  One highlight was the battered sweet potato fries.  \\n\\n Would I try this restaurant again?  Probably not.  We're lunch diners and with Wildflower Bread Co down the street, their food is so much better.\n",

            "Review: I have to give this restaurant 1 star because of a single employee's lack of interest in doing her job. A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again \\\"so you guys aren't open?\\\", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.\\n\\nThis happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.  I would encourage management to look into who was working the podium at that time and have a talk with her about priorities.\n",

I went with friends last year, and until this year I thought it was the best steak I'd ever had.  It was cooked to perfection and had a really nice pepper rub that must have left a crust an inch thick.  If you're not into peppery crusts, then you might find the cow at this place not to your liking.  Anyway, the steak was great, the desserts were yummy, the side dishes were  average (as all sides seem to be in Vegas), the ambiance was not bad, and I can't remember what I had to drink during the meal.  As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)  The restaurant was definitely crowded and loud, though.  Can't win 'em all, but I sure can deduct a star here and there...!\n",

I think they should STOP, review talk about the pros and cons and have a good training day. Staff were confused on where food went and what table numbers were. You can't have staff walking around looking for who ordered what.\\nPOS the staff was using was phone size and they seemed to struggle with inputting the orders.\\nNow the food, we had a table of 4 and all had something different. Cod bites were good, as were the chicken skewers. I had the Meatloaf which I would give an A, very tasty and the mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned for my taste.\\nAnother dish was the Chicken Noodles, not-so-good, had a very odd taste spices didn't seem to work.\\n3rd dish was the Salmon surf. Pretty hard to screw up Salmon but it was over salted, sorry.\\nLast dish was Fish Tacos. She had Cod tacos instead of Salmon and said she enjoyed it. She wished they offered Black beans with the tacos to make it more authentic, but enjoyed it.\\nDesert we had the Bread pudding. It was very good, not the best in town, but very good.\\n\\nLocation, Location, Location is one of the best in the Valley. I'm not sure why other restaurants have not made it there as it's a wonderful, beautiful location on the Lake in \\\"The Lakes\\\" community. Tons of space inside and on the outside patio, there's even a boat dock for the locals.\\nEntertainment.\\nThey had Live music on the Friday night we were there and they were good. They also have separate areas where you and your friends can play pool, throw darts, or play a little corn hole. Huge bar fully loaded makes it a place you could spend the evening.\\nWho was there?\\nSeemed like a nice mix of people young and old. Decor was very open, maybe even too much but I still liked it. View was amazing.\\n\\nI hope they take the suggestions of their critics good and bad as we'd really love to see this place succeed. With a little tweaking, this could be a place I visit often. We wish them the best of luck, we'll try again in a couple months to see how things progress.\n",

There are homeless people all over the complex, begging, sleeping behind the dumpsters, and what ever else they want to do. My car was stolen, despite the \\\"security\\\" provided, and broken into 2 more times. There was a fatal shooting in December that management never spoke of. Last week they found another dead body and ruled it a homicide again. There are drug deals that happen, graffiti everywhere, and the kids of the complex run around as a gang. I've seen them kick dogs, knock down and elderly woman, and once even try to sexually accost a woman before people stopped them. Management couldn't care less about anything. They are constantly making errors in book keeping, charging you more for rent than you owe, or charging you less, then charging you double for their error. Cockroaches everywhere, broken appliances, playgrounds with trash and needles in them. \\n\\nIf you move here....Good luck. Dont believe my review?

I worked for a catering company when I was at school and I remember having to walk around with trays of various different whiskies for people to take. Every single person asked me which was which and even though I should have arranged them in a manner that made it easy to remember - I didn't. So ended up just making whiskies up... I wasn't fooling anyone. After my whisky experience I still really am none the wiser about any of them but I've bought a few bottles in my time for retirement presents and such.\\n\\nThis store is jam packed and looks very traditional, with all kind of whiskies, they also have other spirits too including a good selection of gins (my favourite), I guess whisky is their speciality though and I'm sure whatever whisky you're looking for you'll find it in here. Great for a souvenir from Scotland, a gift for a whisky drinker or great if you just fancy treating yourself to  fancy new bottle of your favourite whisky.\n",

To the left and right you have seating areas which is meant for dining and drinking. A spiral open staircase  (pick neon chase lights adorned) takes you to the restrooms. Which are clean(ish) where music is piped down to the speakers. - actually they play music in all areas. LOUD. \\nIn the back is smaller bar with a place that can be cordoned off. I was explained this is used a a VIP area or large group private dining. The latter I had experienced and which was well organised, but not so in execution. They had a lack of waiters, well no actually, there were enough staff serving, but they hadn't allocated not enough serving staff to our group. Food was not delivered to all at the same time and drinks orders kept being messed up. This all caused our meal to last longer and we were still eating when the place turned full on night club (23:00) with gyrating people bobbing in your view when on your coffee and cake. \\n\\nOn a different visit the wife and I went for a romantic anniversary meal. Their menu is extensive and a little pricey. I found the waiting staff friendly but difficult to summon. Did I mention the loud music before? Try having a meal for two in the same room were people are shouting drinks orders and are dancing around handbags around you, while in the meanwhile trying to hold a dinner conversation. Fail. It is not a nice experience having to raise your voice and sometimes even shout to the person sitting next to you. As a result most of that meal was spend in silence and using eye contact and hand gestures. An experience? yes. Romantic? no.\\n\\nThe last time I visited was with few friends from Italy and Switzerland and we used a booth in the corner, and oh.. what is that white thing on the wall pointing into that booth? yes.. a loudspeaker. We persevered and with a few cocktails and several shots of vodka it was easily overcome - just huddle together and shout like you were giving instruction to a rugby team. Italians are very well adapt to this, they actually enjoyed themselves - so a hit for them and a good choice if you are into this kind of environment and atmosphere. Loud, lively, bubbly and no chance of a conversation (no way you can use a pick-up line under these circumstances)\\n\\nSo on all occasions it was the noise that ruined any experience of a nice evening, that... or maybe I am getting too old for this.\n",

I've been to most, 6 flags, etc. \\n\\nWhy is this my favourite? \\nBecause they have as many coasters as some of the bigger parks without being as well known.

Anyway, I had major service done here about a month ago and had oil change, clutch flush, brake fluids, spark plugs and one other thing done (I can't remember). Anyway, I went to Honda Culver City (los angeles) a week ago and they found that all 4 of my brake pads were \\\"dangerously low\\\" and that my car wasn't even safe to drive with brake pads that low. I think the service agent told me that the brake pads were 0.5mm. You can call Honda Culver City to verify. How can Honda West check my clutch, brake fluids and other stuff and not see that my brake pads are that low? I even told the service guy that I'm going to be doing a long drive and asked to check the car. Thanks for letting me drive my car when it's unsafe to do so. Apparently your customer's safety isn't your priority. I could sue you guys for this\n",

            "Review: First five stars I have given. This place is to die! My cousins brought me here with my niece for my birthday brunch. I have never been happier. Located atop the pool at the M Resort, its pretty easy  to find and parking is a breeze as the M has plenty. The wait was nonexistent as we came on Friday mid afternoon, but expect a wait for Sunday Brunch. The decor is farmhouse meets fancy pants. We were seated overlooking the pool with a great view of the Valley just past. The server was very friendly and was nice enough to joke and play with my 3 yr old niece. For drinks, myself and one cousin ordered Pabst Blue Ribbon which were served in the can with a chilled glass. My other cousin, not one for spirits, ordered the Iced Pistachio Mocha. Wonderfully nutty, with a tasty espresso base. We ordered an Apple juice for the little one and were stoked to see a regular sized drink (in a plastic, covered, strawed cup) (none of that asshole-ish 4 bucks for a shot BS) and it was Simply Apple! For the food, we decided to get a Farmer's Daughter combo for the babe. The pancake was the size of her head! It also came with a side of eggs and sausage. The eggs are the one thing I didn't like. Something they put in them didn't sit well with my tastebuds. The sausage was grand. Two links that had a crisp skin, soft center and a faint lavender taste that surprised all of us. For the big kids we decided to split two plates among us as the portions are giant! We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Meatloaf Hash. The chicken and waffles came in the form of a giant tower of awesome! Four fresh waffles topped with two deep fried chicken breasts and a huge stalk of sage rising proudly from the center, capping the dish off at about 18 inches tall. The chicken was moist and juicy with a flavorful thin breading. The waffles had bacon cooked right into the center of them, that helped translate the sweet waffles and syrup to the savory chicken easily. It was topped with fried leeks, which also had great flavor. (try them). The Meatloaf Hash came in a giant skillet, with eggs, seasonal fruit and a hearty biscuit. The hash itself had fried potatoes, spinach and a medley of bell peppers, perfectly sweated and covered in ooey gooey cheese.  The meatloaf itself had that perfect day old taste you'd expect for use in a hash. Phenomenal!!!! The biscuit was a classic recipe, nothing too special, but each table has a small jar of preserves. These may be seasonal, but the spread du jour was a mix of peach and apricot. There was no label on it, you could literally taste both of those fruits distinctly. If all of this wasn't enough, the presentation was astounding. Every few moments another giant fortress of food would emerge from the kitchen. You can tell they take great pride in every piece of culinary kitsch they send out. EVERYONE GO HERE!\n",

You can't get out of the frikken state on that airline for less than $400 no matter where you are going. Still it was the easy choice so I flew it a lot. Sometimes paying for convenience is worth it. \\n\\nRecently, I took them back from Jamaica with a layover in CLT and can't say I was too impressed. On one hand, they got us home earlier and adverted a potential delay. Plus, I was on a couple of the newest planes (complete with wi-fi) I have ever been on. \\n\\nOn the other hand, they cut our layovers so short it made us run for every plane! They charged $25/bag for an international flight (I didn't even know any airlines charged for the first bag on international - apparently US Air is one of only a few). Oh and they didn't seat my husband and I together, even though none of our flights were full and they easily could have!? \\n\\nI think I will skip them in the future.\n",

The wait is ridiculous, but if you have $$$ get bottle service, or if you have homies in Vegas with hook ups, call them!  It is definitely worth the hassle.  You want to look good, dress sexy, and bring lots of cash and credit to buy drinks.  Drinks cost lots...but everywhere in vegas its muy expensive!  This place has one of the largest patios near their pool to chill, smoke, meet people, and chat throughout the long hours of the night til dawn.  The dance floor is pretty big too, not too crowded.  It opens up into the patio area, so the place is well ventilated.   You can even dip your feet in the pool if it starts sweating in your sandals to rid of any vinegar smell you may have developed haha.  Vegas always has a good diverse crowd with a DJ who places music to fit everyone's taste.  I think the fact that this place is huge, and the patio is huge, and the fact that everyone wants to go somewhere new, this place is definitely the spot!  \\n\\nPlanning a bachelorette or bachelor party? do it here.  My girl and I met so many people about to get married and had their bottle service there.  Its super expensive so be ready to let go of some ends!  It was even fun with just me and my girlfriend, dancing the night away, walking around and chit chatting w/ everyone.  The main thing is, you CAN walk around, you CAN see people, AND even better, no long lines to go pee!  It's not super crowded or dark like Tao.

            "Review: Had a bad experience here. Firstly, I ordered the pizza which looked fantastic but had zero flavor. Zero. There was literally no flavor. I very nicely said this to the waitress when she asked. I was offered something else so I ordered gnocchi which was good. The sauce was underwhelming but not bad. My husband got steak which was cut in medallions. It was good, nice flavor and cooked just right. Pricey for the portion but good. Would order again good. Here's the rub; I would have been willing to try Amaro again had it not been for the classless way the owner handled the fact that I didn't care for the pizza. She came to the table for all of 3 seconds and then charged us $8.00 for the pizza because we \\\"ate a piece.\\\"  Given that I didn't ask to replace the pizza and was never told about the charge until the bill came it just hit me as rude. I paid $8 for one PC of flavorless pizza. And the general attitude shift after I was honest about not liking it. And btw I was nice about it. Really nice about it because it was just bland for me. Someone else may like it just fine. It's not so much the money as the rude service. I don't mind paying for a nice meal. But part of that is service. Can't support this place.\n",

I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\\n\\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.  \\n\\nThey don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \\\"we have fries here!\\\" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?\\n\\nI've come to believe that everyone at Tessaro's is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away. But you  keep going back. \\n\\nHave some pity for the poor cursed Tessaro workers, and just go up the street to BRGR, or downtown to Winghart's.\n",

You can go on line or check in on their computer. It is totally cool, except that it takes a long time to check in. I am not sure if it saved my data from last time, I had to enter everything again. This thing is nice but very inefficient. \\n\\nb.  The Nurse Practitioner. 5 star - I thought this person was really good and explained everything. Helpful, caring and efficient.\\n\\nc.  Services offered - Saves you from having to pay high fees and long wait times at the other urgent care places. I think this is great.\\n\\nd.  Privacy - Limited. As they start talking to you in the main reception area, everyone waiting in this small modest area can hear you.  They end up taking you inside the room for more details, but the privacy is a bit sketchy in my book.\\n\\ne.  Charges - We are under 60 but got the shingle vaccine.  Cost is over 200.00 per person. This is standard as insurances will cover you after 60, but before it is on you.  I accept this but the system they have and how you check in does not let you know this in detail.  And, what is worse, the clinics billing is poor. I paid all my fees on Amex and still getting a bill to pay the fees from their central billing department. This bill is poorly done, not too much information and on the back there is no data on what to do if you dispute or anything like terms or conditions. \\n\\nI will come back again, as it is cheaper than urgent care, but this place is not too inviting as the experience is kind of blah.\n",

The only reason they gave me one room key to only one of our rooms is cause I started crying. To top it off they call us at 1am to tell us our other room is ready but yet don't comp us for that night. They had the girls get ready in their spa and then check their luggage back in at the desk. \\n\\nOverall the only thing they did for us was give us food credit and comp the resort fee. I honestly believe they could have and should have done more for us since we only got one room at a time and the second room that was ready at 1am wasn't the right one, it only had one bed and the shower didn't work well so we had to have the girls in that room switch rooms again on Sat to one with two beds. \\n\\nThere was a lot of inconveniences at this hotel that I wouldn't have expected and will not stay there again because of this.

I was at one point dragged to this place since a bunch of friends were meeting up and I wasn't about to miss out on fun times because I don't like burgers. So, I sucked it up and went. There is a huge cow mural on the wall, beckoning you to eat him, or one of his family members. So far, so good. I ordered a few drinks, all of which were very good (although pricey). I got the Kobe burger, and good God was it delicious! It melts in your mouth, and all of the flavor is there, stewing in the juices of this mighty burger. I have been back here several times since and without kicking and screaming. This is the only burger place I really enjoy coming back to. Also, the milkshakes are to die for (cookies n cream FTW!). Go check these guys out. Soooo yummy!\n",

Rather than being stuck in the office and miss out on the lunch gossip, I always opted to go, and EVERY time, it was the same old story...this place is never too busy during lunch, but service is slower than the second coming. It would take 1.5 - 2 hours for the small group of us to make it through lunch. Not to mention that after consuming my first beverage, the glass would remain empty, my number one dining pet peeve. \\n\\nI do have to say that I can't completely hate on Zipps because their food really is good. They have awesome nachos and sandwhiches. I have never been disappointed with the quality of my food. And when I was having a calorie splurge day, Zipp's pizookie was the perfect way to do it! \\n\\nZipps gets a 2 star rating from me, but if they get their service act together, we can negotiate a better score...\n",

They get the one star for convenience. \\nBut the fellow there had me in line already and just because a couple of others had completed their service, he told me, \\\"Let me take care of these guys first.\\\" \\nI had come in for an oil change, and I asked if there was an extra charge for rotating tires. They said no. I asked them how long, they said maybe an hour. So, I indicated to them to call me when it is done.\\n3 hrs later, I called them to find out if it was done yet. They put me on hold for 4 minutes. They told me it would be ready when I get there. \\nSo, I went back and stood behind one other guy, and made eye contact with the same guy who prepared my order earlier. He left the counter area to find out what was going on. He returned and said, \\\"Give me a minute, lemme just take care of this guy.\\\" So, I had to wait again. \\nWhen he got my keys for me, he added, \\\"Oh, they forgot to rotate your tires.\\\" \\nSo, to summarize: they are slow with oil changes(3 hrs), they are inconsistent with who gets helped first (they selectively choose who gets helpe first rather than who's in line), they lie about how fast they can do something (they said 1 hr), and they don't do everything they promised to do (didn't do the tire rotation).\\nI wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.\n",

I live in Stockholm now and was entertaining notions of going back to Champaign to do another degree, but really...it's an isolated place if you don't have a car. It shouldn't be a big deal to go to Chicago. It shouldn't use up all my money or my patience. I've had 11 hour delays on Amtrak! Chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city. The fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the University. \\n\\nSweden benefits enormously from having fast, relatively cheap, and hassle-free railway. I don't have to sit on a cramped bus next to a McDonalds eating elementary school kid or endure six hour delays on a crappy train to get to places like Oslo and Copenhagen. I'm bragging now, but UIUC needs Amtrak to shape up.\n",

This one you sit down and are served. Both times I went on a Friday night after a movie and it was a little crowded. There may be waiting if there are more than 2 of you, but it's not a long wait if you do. The first time our waitress was good. Last night, the waiter was okay. I'm too busy eating and enjoying the food to really let that part bother me too much. Around 6-7pm last night, it was nice to sit outside on the patio since the sun had already gone down, but if you go earlier, there is shading over the patio.\\n\\nThe cilantro jalepeno hummus is \\\"Ah-mazing!\\\" Don't worry about it being too spicy, because it's just the right amount of spice that balances the cilantro flavor. \\n\\nThe pesto pizza is delicious! We added chicken though which made it more filling! \\n\\nAs other reviewers had said, it feels like everything is so fresh and you don't feel overwhelmed with gluttony once you are done. With the exception of the falafel, not many things are deep fried. Most foods here are grilled or baked. All of the meats and some veggies are marinated, so everything you order is full of flavor.\n",

I will be making sure to come in here for my next music purchase.\\n\\nA couple of things that I noticed on my visit.  Firstly, there was no music playing in the background, which is surely something that you'd expect from a music shop.  Secondly, the guy in there was on the phone during the whole time I was in the shop, even serving a customer whilst maintaining the conversation.  I can't be sure if this was a particularly important call or not, but I'm sure he could have put the phone down to look after his customers.\\n\\nThis is a minor quibble however, as the other reviewers all speak so highly of this place.  Judging by the sign on the front, they're going to be relocating soon, but I'm sure that music fans across the city will be able to enjoy Avalanche for a long time yet.\\n\\n[Insert suitable avalanche-based pun.]\n",

If you have the unfortunate timing to have issues with the workings of the business while Vinny is in charge, nothing will get solved. Vinny is one of the owner's relatives and treats you exactly like one would expect - terribly because he can get away with it. He will smirk at you like a sleezy used car salesman, if it wasn't already obvious that since he already has your money, there's nothing he's willing to do for you. \\n\\nThey allow too many people into each game (up to 60) so if you have problems with your pack, which has likely a 25% chance of failure, you are forced into a cycle of being shot and not able to play since everyone else got a 30 second start. \\n\\nAlso, if they're having a special that you call to confirm, be advised that the employees may not give you all of the information needed to get the special, such as the need to physically print coupons, and, of course, Vinny will do nothing to remedy the situation. \\n\\nTL; DR: Save your time, money, and frustration and go to Laser Quest, where you also get to make up silly player names.\n",

            "Review: My wife and I went here for happy hour on a Thursday evening and were disappointed with the customer service we received. Let me start with them advertising 1/2 off draught beer and wine by the glass. It began when I ordered a Dogfish 90 Minute IPA which there was clearly a problem with as both the server and bartender were pouring tasters to taste it. Regardless, they served me the beer with zero mention of a problem. After trying the beer I called the server over and reported that it was extremely flat. To which he replied \\\" I was affraid of that. The keg is out of CO2.\\\" Okay then, thanks for serving me a flat beer that you tasted and knew was bad!\\n\\nAlright then, well Ill have the Odell Double black IPA off the menu. \\\"No sir we are out of that beer.\\\" Okay, then Ill take the Odell Double Pils. The server disappears and comes back to ask if I want the 12 oz or 17 oz. I reply \\\"well since it is happy hour ill take the one that is on happy hour.\\\" To which the server replies \\\"that beer is not on the happy hour menu.\\\" Perfect so the Dogfish is bad, the double black IPA is gone and the double pils is not on happy hour. \\\"Il have the the 4Peaks Pumpkin Porter sir.\\\" Luckily my beer arrives! \\n\\nNow ordering appetizers. They are completely out of wings so no parmesan or the other flavor they had. Bummer. Luckily the ribs they had were great! A great cherry cola sauce. Also, the red pepper slider burger with grilled onions was delicious. No complaints with the taste of the food. Just surprised they are completely out of wing which made up 2 of the 8 items on their happy hour menu. \\n\\nThen, when the check came we were charged full price on the beer to which the server came back and said \\\"that pumpkin porter you ordered was NOT on the happy hour price.\\\" Really! I asked 2 times for beers that were on the happy hour price and when you greeted us you mentioned that we were seated in time for happy hour. Also, you guys were out of my first 2 beer selections and had to decline me on another that again wasnt on the happy hour price. Plus the wings we wanted you guys also didn't have. Then we were inadvertently charged non-happy our prices on the ribs that needed to be corrected.\\n\\nLastly, as my wife and I were discussing the rather unique (awful) service we received the owner overheard us walking out and asked \\\"Did we have a problem with something??\\\" Really? You are gonna charge after us and ask if there was a problem when we are halfway to our car? After explaining the whole beer fiasco and the confusion they create with \\\"happy hour prices\\\" on select draughts the owner didn't apologize once for anything (lack of advertised druaghts, lack of wings, incorrect charges) and basically sent us on our way. Im still not sure what beers are on Happy Hour prices because the server won't let you know and there is zero clarity in the actual bar. Super disappointing experience.\n",

            "Review: Our first mistake was deciding on where to go for dinner a little late in the evening. When we arrived I was super hungry. We had two servers, neither of which could seem to serve us with any decency in speed or clarity. By the time our food arrived, I felt like I had already been in the restaurant way too long. There were quite a few other patrons in the place, but it wasn't packed with a wait to be seated. \\n\\nMy second mistake was assuming that Tea is unflavored. No, it's Passion Fruit Tea. Adam Carolla has a rant about Passion Fruit Tea, and I am thinking of joining his Army after my experience at Mezzo. All she had to do was to give me a heads up. Heck, I might have even ordered it even knowing, but when I took a sip of my tea, expecting a familiar taste only to find that I had been fooled. \\n\\nMy food was good, but maybe it was just because I was so starved by the time it arrived that I would have enjoyed a shoe just as much. \\n\\nI can say ONE positive thing about Mezzo, and it's that their Pizza Frittes dessert is PHENOMENAL! They're fried dough bites with powered sugar, similar to bits of funnel cake. I ordered mine to go (since we had been there so long that I felt like I had moved into the place), and they piled them high in the take out box. They were even good the next day. I would go back to Mezzo just for the Pizza Frittes but definitely get them to go....without the tea.\n",

The super stuffed only comes with and extra layer of crust above the pizza. You get more by ordering a original sicilian with more toppings.\n",

            "Review: I never really had Indian food in Vegas, but wanted to try some nice place. The reviews for this place and Tamba were nice, but wanted to find some place off the strip and with easy parking so picked Mint.\\n\\nThe place looks little shady from outside, the plaza was dark and the restaurant did not seem very brightly lit from outside. But don't worry it's a great place from inside. The decor is nice and upscale. It's a quite place, with comfortable seating. The lights could be brighter. There were few other table's occupied (All by Indians) - A good sight if you are looking for true Indian spicy food and not tamed down for the American population. \\n\\nThe waiter was nice, pleasant and took out his iPhone while talking to us. Realized within minutes he was noting down our order with an app from the app store. Also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time.\\n\\nComing to the main part! FOOD! It was really good. \\nWe ordered Mint Lassi and Masala Chhas. Both were very Indian and really tasty. \\nTheir Menu is very well organized. Great for Vegetarians and Vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans. Very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well. One of the best organized Menu's among all restaurants (Comparing to all Indian, American etc. restaurants).\\n\\nFor the main course we ordered Paneer Makhani, Daal Makhani and Chole With Naans. Everything was really good. Daal Was very tasty, although the color might make you think its not the best, but trust me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home. Naan's were also very good. \\n\\nThey also have Nepalese  food but did not try it, but would love to try that too. \\nOverall great place if you are looking for true Indian Food. Would definitely go back again.\n",

            "Review: One month!  Why didn't I follow my one month rule?  I usually wait a month after a restaurant opens up before going there for dinner, but I haven't been to Binkley's or Cafe Bink before.  With all the great things I heard, I had to go to Bink's Midtown as soon as I could. I regretted it.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night and waited to talk to the hostess.  We waited a while, and I started to see what was happening up front.  The guy ahead of me said.. \\\"hey, what's going on? do we have a table or should i wait outside.. what do you want me to do?\\\" they finally told him his table was ready.  \\n\\nMy turn came up and I sat there for 5 minutes watching them take one page after another and clip them together.  Why didn't they do this before hand? We were seated right next to the front door, but I would have rather been in the more inviting living room.  At least I wasn't seated outside where it was freezing.\\n\\nOur water came out promptly, but we waited 10 minutes before the server came.  We ordered a carafe of wine and waited another 15 minutes before that came out.\\n\\nService aside, I was excited by the menu.  We ordered the beets, leeks, risotto, mussels, parsnip soup, sweetbreads, beignets, squash, and brussel sprouts.  The waiter's eyes went a little wide, and he grabbed the table next to us to make more room.  Five minutes later the hostess came by and asked if we were expecting more people and why we didn't tell them?  I felt offended that they thought I pulled over a table and didn't say anything to them.  I explained the situation, they paused, and he walked away.\\n\\n20 minutes later. yes, 20 minutes later. our food finally arrived.  Of course, as they were putting the food on the table, they knocked over a glass of wine on to my girlfriend.  She somehow ninja'ed her way from getting anything spilled on her.  The worse of it all though, was she had to ask 2 different people to replace her glass of wine.\\n\\nThe food was some highs and lows.  The foei gras donuts and mussels were okay.  The leaks, beets, and risotto were great.  We especially loved the cheeks in the leaks.\\n\\nOverall though, I just wasn't happy with the place.  The service was horrible, and the staff had no energy or personality.  With all the waits we endured, I just can't recommend this place to anyone at all.\\n\\nWhat's worse is I give the valet my ticket and watch him almost stall out my car 3 or 4 times while trying to back up.\\n\\nMy two cents. Stay away for a few months.  Maybe then things will get better.\n",

I would give Gold's Gym a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the billing practices. \\n\\nMy husband and I signed up almost 2 years ago and at the time were signed in to a 2 year contract paying around $17 a month as our big corporate discount. Since that time Gold's has offered a $9 month to month membership as long as you don't participate in classes which we don't. I called to see what we would need to do to switch to the reduced program and was told that we would not be able to until our original contract was up and then we would each need to pay $100 to reduce to the lower $9 month to month membership. \\n\\nAs a customer it feels like you are being punished for being loyal and signing up before the other month to month members. It seems to me that if I was willing to sign up for 2 years knowing I would have to pay every month that I was in for the long haul which may not be the case with your newbie month to monther's. I personally do not feel members should be penalized if they signed up before Gold's offered this new membership.

No problem...I've been a newbie before too.  Our server was a little over the top with the constant mispronunciation of \\\"beautiful\\\", he kept saying \\\"bootiful\\\" and he kept reaching over us to remove empty dishes from the table; he just needs a little more training and seasoning and he'll be fine.\\nThe appetizer was a grill artichoke that we shared and it came with this great tasting garlic, pesto and basil aioli.  We devoured that in a short period of time.\\nNext, we split the French Dip sandwich; the meat was a little too fatty and even though we split the dip, I mean c'mon Paul Martin, you can spare a decent amount of the au jus, can't 'cha??  The au jus was served in this way too small and too deep Japanese teacup-like container which it made it difficult to \\\"dip\\\" our French dip.  The horseradish/mayonnaise dip was creamy and good, pretty standard.  The shoestring fries was done well and crispy.\\nWe also had the mac and cheese that had pieces of prosciutto in it and it was a unique taste, the broiled top was nice and crunchy!\\nWith that being said, our wait time after we got the appetizer was way too long and appeared isolated however that is my biggest pet peeve is the food took too  long AND it seems that I am the one who has to recognize it and point it out to the staff.  Once I let the server know that it's taking a long time, it was then he let his manager know.  Manager addressed us and was nervous about approaching us (he seemed to be a young and new manager as well) and he did his best in explaining the situation but it was painful watching him stumble (ok, not so painful as amusing).  \\nWhen the food did arrive, it did come out nice and hot so that was a plus!  They also comped our meal as a way of apologizing for the delay.  \\nA golf clap for the food...and since they showed that in the end it is about customer satisfaction, we are going to try Paul Martin again.\n",

They made it clear that they close by 9:30pm and that they were ready for us to go. However,the server was pretty friendly and fast.\\n\\nThe food was just okay. The rolls were very average at best, not tightly rolled. The Catepillar roll had a very sweet eel sauce (more like a maple flavored sauce) and it was hard to eat. We had to remind them that our order was not all complete...perhaps in the rush to get our food out so we could leave by the time they closed, they may have overlooked or order. \\n\\nI'm confused about how this place got such high reviews, since they didn't even come close in my experience.\n",

            "Review: I've been talking about this search for the perfect reuben for so long that people are starting to wonder. I figured that I'd better start documenting this search lest people begin to question my dedication to the task at hand.\\n\\nI hadn't been to Ella's since I relocated to Madison 7yrs. ago. So I figured that this Madison Institution would be a good place to start. So, the sandwich was pretty decent. The corned beef was delicious and not too greasy. I don't know why they don't serve it on a dark rye, like most every other place I've had one (we'll forget the sourdough I had once in the north woods). Loss of points here. My only other gripe would be that they could have spared some fries and made a bigger sandwich.\\n\\nThe reason for the two star rating is the service I received. I was one of maybe four customers in the whole place (everyone else was already seated and eating when I arrived), and it still took ten minutes for a staffer to bring a cup of water. The server's demeanor was short and far from sweet.\\n\\nSo, bring the kids to Ella's. That's the demographic they're going for. It's like Chuck-E-Cheese for the pre-teen steampunk crowd. If you're looking for a decent reuben in Madison, get it to go.\n",

            "Review: Visited for lunch on Sunday after several attempts to find them open for dinner failed. I did watch the Investors show but since I live very nearby and was a customer of previous business I looked this place up in Yelp prior. Which is how I knew about the show. \\nBut onto to food and such. We were greeted by the owner/ wife Caroline and she took our drink order immediately. The Mr. ordered the Philly sandwich and I choose the Seoul burger. We both choose garlic fries.\\nI was pretty happy with mine. Maybe a tad more salt on the burger, but it was good overall. The Philly, which I tasted and agree with my Mr. was bland and the meat was seriously lacking in flavor and seasoning. The fries were good though. \\nThe service was.... there. She was attentive. Then not. But Robert the chef/owner checked on us and the food was good. Not as stupendous as I was led to believe but I just might go back. \\nI have one issue that I find unacceptable at any restaurant. Lack of cleanliness. The floor clearly had not been scrubbed completely in weeks, the rug by the front door needed to be vacuumed. The silver used around the restaurant is dirty. I didn't get close enough to look at the kitchen. It is open so I could have. I am not saying they don't clean. Just that they need to do better. \\nSo if you are looking for a tasty burger and some decent but average garlic fries, stop in here, but get it to go unless you like dirty diner chic. I am going to give the chef credit for keeping a clean kitchen. I hope I am right.\n",

            "Review: First, you have to be transferred to so many people before finally someone can understand an issue. I have had service to my water heater and to my air conditioning. The water heater guy was a complete cocky a**hole, not only called 10 minutes before the last possible time he could be here (they told me between 9-12p) and said it'll be another hour or so, no apology. Once he arrived, he said I needed a whole bunch of \\\"up to code\\\" stuff. When I checked with other companies, they said I didn't need all that. Air Pro had to do the install per home warranty, but I got the un needed charges that I was told by the water heater guy that I \\\"needed\\\" off, it was $120 worth of stuff not covered by home warranty. The comment by Maggie about the \\\"required\\\" disposal for $180 also was told to me, when I looked into it, I found out it's not required and I can do it myself.\\nThe man that came out for the a/c was very nice and helpful, no problem with the a/c worker.\\nI have a new issue with my AquaTherm system, something that works with my water heater to keep my house warm....something I obviously won't need to have run in the Summer....but it has been running,and gas bill is 3x what it should be, so I called my home warranty company and they sent the same a**hole from AirPro that installed my water heater. So unprofessional, he said \\\"who installed that water heater, cause they did a good job\\\". I didn't find it funny. He just looked at the AquaTherm and said there is nothing wrong with it, and he doesn't work on those, so I'll need to call the home warranty company back and Air Pro will need to send someone that works on the air conditioning, because it's those people who work on the AquaTherm....so that's what I did. I explained very clearly that it is not the a/c and not the water heater, but my AquaTherm system that needed repair, and I'm no tech, but my AquaTherm works with my water heater, so why does someone who works on a/c need to repair it? So Air Pro sends another person who can't fix it and they tell me it is a plumbing issue and they will have to call and schedule that.....who knows what issue it will be next, but this system running is costing me money each day and the people at Air Pro don't seem to care or want to help.\n",

It is tucked in the corner right next to Paradise Bakery if you have a hard time finding it. \\n\\nThis is basically Chipotle for pizzas.  They have set salads & build your own salad as well.  My parents chose this option and they really enjoyed their salads, but they are pretty big so they were unable to finish them.\\n\\nThe line was decent size, but went very quick.  The pizza options were broken down to several categories: sauce, cheese, meat, veggies, and fresh herbs.  They do not charge more for adding any of the options (don't know if you ask for extra portions though).  I suggest that you do not get fresh tomato, it makes the pizza very soggy afterwards.  I made the mistake, don't repeat it!  Other than that, my pizza was delicious!  I also had the Pookie, just love that name!  Don't be surprised, it is a normal sized cookie.  I am so used to huge cookies done this way, but it's only $3 so you cannot expect too much.  \\n\\nWarning, they do have Pepsi products!  Boo!  They also do have a nice selection of iced teas so that made up for the Pepsi faux pas. \\n\\nWill I be back?  Definitely, but will not order the fresh tomatoes on my pizza.\n",

            "Review: Located in the western end of Willy St, Wah Kee is the best Cantonese/Guangdong style Chinese food in Madison. If you regularly go to restaurants in North American Chinatowns, this place will bring back your memories! \\n\\nWah Kee's menu is huge and even includes some Thai/Vietnamese items, but the highlights are in its Cantonese selections. Anything in the Lo Mein section is pretty good. Wonton Lo Mein is my favorite. They made wontons fresh and they are among the best I had in this country. \\n\\nThey offer some really authentic appetizers. I recommend you to resist your urge to order spring rolls and try out \\\"fried turnip cake\\\", \\\"Yau Choi in Oyster Sauce\\\", \\\"Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf\\\", \\\"BBQ pork buns\\\", or \\\"scallion pancake.\\\" It's pretty rare that you can find these dishes in the Midwest. \\n\\nRice in Clay Pot is also Wah Kee's specialty. Expect some preparing time but they worth the wait. \\n\\nI wanted to give it 5 stars (as appeared in the very first version of the review) because it is such a bargain for budget foodies, but 4 stars probably will do justice to other Chinese eateries in town. Nonetheless, Wah Kee is one of the best meals you can get under $10 in the Madtown.\n",

            "Review: My friend and I stayed at the NRH for three nights during the Jazz Festival.  It was pretty easy to get to.  We took the 747 from the airport and got off at Stop #7 and walked 15 minutes up Bleury (which turns into Parc).  On future days, we used the 80 which runs up and down Parc (good for getting up to Fairmount Bagel).  You are roughly three blocks south of Parc-Royal.\\n\\nI made my reservations via fax and received an email confirmation within 12 hours.  We stopped at the front desk and check-in was a simple process.  We were given info on the wifi (which worked very well), and breakfast.  We took the elevator up to the 10th floor and found our room at the end of the hallway.  The room was modestly decorated in a classic dormitory style.  That is to say, two of everything - beds, desks, dresser, and shelves.  \\n\\nI thought the room was decent for the price we paid.  Towels were solid, toiletries were by Bath & Body Works.  TV was small, but manageable.  If there was one disappointment, it was that the A/C was a little lacking.  Not a big deal, but it meant I didn't need the comforter.\\n\\nAs mentioned, the location is great.  You've got restaurants all around you, a grocery store a couple of blocks away, and Saint Laurent is three blocks east.  The 80 bus stops outside the NRH, and McGill University is just a block up.\\n\\nKeep your expectations modest, and I think you'll be pleased.

            "Review: LET'S BE TRUTHFUL... \\n\\nLast week I decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the Strip. I booked a room at the TI and after check-in, took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering. I stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the $23 per person to get in. \\n\\nAs we walked through the dining area I noticed about 18 diners in the restaurant (odd for a 7:30pm dinner I thought) who were not really eating much. Must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks... no real food. We arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said... \\n\\n\\\"Is it just me, or does this entire place look tired?\\\" \\n\\nI thought to myself and replied, \\\"Sweetie, I don't understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top, the cold food is shriveled, and the employees are all frowning... but that doesn't effect how much fun we'll have tonight, right? After seeing her expression, I immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register. \\n\\nNotwithstanding the terrible looking food, the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a Hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else... I found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when I asked for a refund. We left, walked across the street to the Palazzo and enjoyed a great Italian dinner. \\n\\n\\nPERSONAL NOTE TO PHIL RUFFIN, OWNER OF THE TI\\n\\nI was born and raised in Las Vegas, and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel/casino. I'm proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining Las Vegas has to offer. This buffet, the air quality in the casino, the poor cleanliness of the room, (our room had burnt out light bulbs, yuck on the dresser, broken dresser drawer hanging out, and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair) and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what I envisioned any tourist should experience. When this property opened it was fantastic, enjoyable, and affordable, and most important the air was breathable. When we arrived in our room, my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her Asthma. Perhaps you'll take these recommendations to heart?\\n\\nIf you have a similar experience at this or any other Las Vegas property, please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game. I would be happy to stay at the TI again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review, which I would be proud to post. Until then...\n",

            "Review: My hubby and I came here by mistake on a Friday evening. For some reason, I thought that this El Chorro was the same Mexican food restaurant that we used to go to in Tucson, but this restaurant was entirely different. The chicken enchilada dish was only one dish on the entire menu that was Mexican.  Oops, my bad! I guess I should've checked with Yelp first to determine what type of restaurant it was, How cool is it that a restaurant reused what was once a girls' school and converted it to one of the most renowned destination restaurants?!\\n\\nThe ambiance was much different as well. It was more refined, polished, and provided a beautiful backdrop of Camelback Mountain. It felt warm and cozy as well, as though we were entering a nestled mission in the middle of the desert. The patio was very inviting and filled with people enjoying good conversation and food under trees covered in warm lighting. Had I researched first, I might've worn something nicer, instead of our extra casual attire. DId that matter to them? No, they treated us very well! Our waiter James was very attentive and made sure that we had no shortage of their famous sticky buns. The sticky buns are so good that they even take orders  \\\"To Go\\\" if you so desire.\\n\\nWe started off with the Pepper Pot Shrimp Appetizer. It was served with rich, flavorful shrimp bathed in a pepper stew that could've been an entree in itself. The toasted homemade bread reached a state of nirvana  in taste once it was dipped in the pepper pot stew mixture. \\n\\nWe splurged and tried the Chateaubriand meal for two. It came with the most tender, meaty goodness of filet served medium rare  (as requested) roasted in the oven and served with sides of a cabernet type red sauce made from the filet's own juices and also a decadent, creamy Bernaise sauce. Roasted asparagus, carrots, and red seasoned potatoes surrounded this platter of perfection. \\n\\nThe chateaubriand meal also came with a dessert. We chose a butter cake with Dolce de Leche ice cream. Forget your typical Sara Lee pound cake. This butter cake puts that Sara Lee pound cake to shame! The cake was neither dense nor too light and flaky. The cake's texture was that of a thicker sponge, but the fork cut easily though the cake like butter. The sweet Dolce de Leche ice cream with the cream cheese, and thicker spongy cake complimented each other quite well. \\n\\nWe were so tired by the end of all this eating that we woke ourselves up with some espresso there and called it a night. After the appetizer, wine, the magnificent Chateaubriand, and dessert with espresso, let's just say our bill was not cheap. In fact, I would definitely call the night done \\\"on a whim\\\" one of those crazy splurges. That won't stop us from coming back for more though! Bravo El Chorro for giving us a wonderful night to remember!\n",

Said the chicken was being fresh cooked.  Manager finally came by and offered us a free tapas to ease the wait (nice touch).  But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience.\n",

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  \\n\\nWe ordered the \\\"Roasted Crispy Duck\\\" appetizer and was told that it actually wasn't crispy, but just roasted.  We got it anyway and it was disgusting.  The taste was lousy and it was some of the worst duck I've ever had.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Cashew Chicken.  Our waitress came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and told us they were out of cashews, but they would make it without cashews.  Are you kidding me?

The banner out front said they were under new management, but I have to agree with Mary L. in that we'll go to the 5 and Diner at Arrowhead before we'll go back to this location.  My veggie sandwich had one enormous piece of cucumber (not thin slices that would actually make sense in a sandwich), but was otherwise what I expected.  Nothing fancy, just veggies and cheese on bread.  My daughter's grilled cheese was better, but her fruit cup was a little weird.  None of the ice cream, fountain, or dessert choices were in the menu we wer given and our server didn't know what wet fries were.  My husband's cheeseburger was fine, but nothing to get excited about.\\n\\nI didn't see a jukebox and the wait staff all wore jeans and T-shirts.  How is that \\\"Delux\\\"?

To describe the food as lack luster is actually kind. The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was \\\"wonderful\\\". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch.\\nThe wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list. You are forced walk around the shop to find what you want, which is usually a wonderful, but occasionally I find that it would be nice to have a list to guide you.\n",

            "Review: This was the first of three lunch dates that the No1DP and I had over our last Vegas stay. While doing research on potential restaurant dates I heard about this restaurant opening recently next to the area where the Venetian turns into the Palazzo. \\n\\nBuddy V's is the interpretation of classical, comfort Italian food of Buddy Valastro, the guy from Cake Boss. Located just inside the entrance to the Palazzo shops, there is indoor and \\\"outdoor\\\" seating, a prime location for people-watching.\\n\\nThe service was rather top-notch for a casual restaurant and what I would normally expect for fine dining. Bussers would ask to serve the last of a dish before taking it away as well as push your chair and make your napkin while you are away. I noticed that the busser's voice seemed a little nervous... maybe it was his first time working here? Still did a good job.\\n\\nWine we had was a typical low-oak Chardonnay, which brings out more of the natural flavors of the grape - a similar profile to Sauvingon Blanc. I have to thank the No1DP for this because it was him that I can start finally appreciating Chardonnay, a varietal I've disliked because of its normally oaky profile.\\n\\nI had just arrived from SD a couple hours ago, and wanting a \\\"light\\\" lunch to start our vacation, we chose to do lunch \\\"tapas\\\"-style with the following entrees:\\n\\nGarlic Bread ($9): melted mozzarella & fontina. Garlic bread was crispy. You could see the cheese melt into the bread but the cheese did not soak the bread too much, leaving the bread crispy. The slices were big and a slice and a half would be enough for me as an appetizer. They also were good with the tomato sauce from the meatballs. \\n\\nGrandma's Meatballs ($13): beef, veal & pork, tomato ragu, pecorino. Meatballs were big and juicy, but something seems missing when I just eat meatballs by itself. This seems like it would go better with a pasta dish.\\n\\nBuddy's Caprese ($16): jersey beefsteak tomatoes, burrata, charred green beans, balsamic. I judge a caprese based on 2 ingredients, the tomatoes and cheese. Cheese was laid out like a poached egg and had a texture of one but the cheese literally just seeps inside your mouth. Tomatoes were plump and juicy. The olive oil/balsamic vinegar combination was not too heavy. Green beans were crispy and the greens were not too heavy as to let the flavors of the cheese and tomatoes shine through.\\n\\nAs we were both full and the No1DP had to go back to a workshop we didn't have room or time for dessert, otherwise I would have loved to try a dessert from the guy who is the star of CAKE BOSS.\\n\\nShould I be around the Grand Canal Shoppes area again I would definitely like to check out their dinner menu as I hear the dinners and desserts are what makes this restaurant stand out from the others.\n",

            "Review: The food and customer service were literally worse than I have ever experienced in my entire life! \\n\\nI went for dinner around 4:30pm on a Saturday. Nearly all of the trays on the buffet were empty. What was left was cold, but I didn't know that until it was on my plate. When I got back to my table I had a bite of orange chicken, which was stone cold. The white rice was hard and cold. I pushed my plate to the side while I debated what to do. One of the waitresses came over and asked if I'd like a drink refill, even though I had only drunk about a third of the glass of soda. I declined and explained that my guest and I were going to be leaving because the food was horrible, but it would be great if we could get a refund. Laney came over and said she'd refund half, but later agreed to refund me for both my meal and my guest's meal, which was as cold and stale as mine. When she came back, Laney presented me with a new receipt for $4, citing that there was nothing wrong with the sodas we ordered. While that was true, I explained I believed that was horribly petty since my guest had drunk none of his soda and I had so little of mine -- and the point of the drinks were to enjoy them with our meals. The man, whom I assume to be Laney's brother, came over and was very apologetic, refunded all of my money and offered to cook us fresh food  free of charge to learn how good his fresh cooking was (We declined.), but he didn't seem to think there was a problem with having cold and stale food on the buffet line. \\n\\nLong story short, I think that China Farm uses quality ingredients and may very well produce good food when cooked to order, but don't count on getting an edible meal at the buffet. The orange chicken was all white meat and the beef and broccoli my guest had was made with quality looking beef and vegetables ... just cold.\n",

I'm only a little ashamed to say I ate the whole thing before leaving the parking lot. It reminded me of burgers hot off the grill from a drive in I frequented as a teen. Now the burger is the only thing I've tried here so its all I can speak to. Its two freshly grilled patties (I order mine with cheese which was melted into the patty just right), set atop your ordinary bun with cool veggies and a sauce that gives it a juicyness, yummm! Its messy but so good. Only bad thing is I live around the corner! I see lots of cheeseburgers in my future.\n",

            "Review: Ok. On the advice of a few friends who have been living in Scottsdale for a little while, I decided to take the gf here for her Bday as Mexican is her fav. We're both from Manhattan and are used to getting damn good street tacos and decent Mexican food. So we come here dressed casual chic and apparently the hordes of locals, many of whom I suspect make 30K a year but acted like they make 1 million plus, were dressed in suits and such. Keep in mind, I am in investment banking and my gf is in fashion so when saw this, were were giggling inside. However, this apparently warranted sub-par service as the waitstaff was apparently ignorant and knows not what they do. No surprise here as Scottsdale and most of the area can be accurately described as trailer trash trying really hard to pretend they live in a real city and actually have real jobs. So what we do is what we always do when we try a \\\"hot restaurant\\\" for the first time, we order the one dish that a place like this should never screw up. We ordered tacos. The meat tasted like it was pulled from some frozen TV dinner box, smothered with way too much sauce and overly salted. We decided to end the night right then and there. It was an absolute disgrace. We have had much better tacos at holes in the walls on random streets in NYC. I still don't understand how this place gets such raves and high reviews. Maybe they've never tasted real, authentic Latin/Mexican food before and this is the only thing they have to benchmark against. Such a sad state of affairs, like so many things in AZ.\n",

            "Review: Strong 2.5 vs 2 star.\\n\\nWhat I like about this place is the convenience factor for me. It is literally right up the street from me. And for what you pay, you get a decent amount. I have gotten a two meat plate combo which runs $14.00 before tax. For this choice, you can choice two meats from either brisket, ribs, chicken, sausage. You also get two sides and can choose from potato salad, pinto beans, baked beans, mac and cheese, cole slaw, or rice.\\n\\nI actually enjoyed their ribs. I am no BBQ connoisseur but I like what I like. The first time they were definitely more tender than the second time i ate there. And the second time the seasoning tasted different. Like they put ole bay seasoning on it, which I am not opposed to, just kind of took me a minute to adjust my expectations.\\n\\nThe brisket was alright the first time. It wasn't overwhelmed with the flavor of smoke and you could see the smoke ring and was pretty tender. The second time, it was just off for me. Definitely not tender and just off. I don't have a specific reason.\\n\\nThe sides here for me are a major fail. The baked beans are straight out of can. The cole slaw was bland. The potato salad is essentially potatoes and mayo only. The mac and cheese was cheesy but too soft and bland. \\n\\nThey offer you BBQ sauce on the side (which is good, nothing great) and onions and pickles. I agree with another yelper and it would be nice if they gave you bread on the side. \\n\\nWould I come back is the question. And the answer is yes. I guess I am a glutton for punishment. I really believe they have a good starting base and can be much better.\\n\\nThey have changed their hours and are now open from 5:30am - 5pm close. They open early to serve breakfast and maybe I will check that out next time.\n",

Frozen, tasteless and very poor quality.     \\nMy biggest complain would be the layout of place. It is impossible to walk without bumping into somebody..

Where do I begin?\\n\\nFirst - the layout.  This design might be nice when one or two people is in the store but on a Saturday afternoon, this place had 30 people in it and was insane.  The layout does not help.  Not only are there three sets of lines that merge into each other creating all sorts of pile-ups but there is no where to go that you aren't in the way.  Racks of food act as line partitions more than they act as display cases.  It is really a nightmare.\\n\\nSecond - quality for the price.  It is a ton of high-end stuff and that's okay.  I have no issue with high end products but ... where the hell do you get off charging $5 more than some place like Delicious Dishes?  I can get the same products at a LOCALLY OWNED store for significantly less.  There is nothing special about what you stock.  You don't make these cheeses yourself.  These aren't your livestock being slaughtered.  You get this stuff from the same supplier that AJs, Trader Joes, and Petit Fromage do yet you charge like you're the only game in town.\\n\\nFinally - You call that a deli counter?  The girls working here have probably been using a meat slicer for 2 months and couldn't tell you the difference between mortadella and sopressata.  I'm sure they don't know how to cook it and can guarantee that they don't know proper pairings.\\n\\nNo thanks.  I'll stick with Delicious Dishes in Phoenix and keep my money local.\n",

Attending a Research Chefs convention and needed to find the best of the best. Since I was with the\\\"meat group\\\" I needed to find a good steakhouse that didn't let me down. This is it. Three of us had the bone in filet which is excellent. The bone in NY Strip and KC Strip are the same and my guest was somewhat disappointed. Had the seafood tower which they created for the 6 of us. Everyone had oysters, lobster tail, crab claws, king crab and jumbo shrimp. That would have been enough for dinner. Our top meathead had the bone in ribeye which is a hard to find item in many restaurants. Even for a guy from Kansas City. For sides we ordered the sauteed mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Served family style. Dessert was amazing as well. Huge pieces of chocolate cake, 3 large scoops of ice cream and I had my usually Mexican coffee served with fresh whipped cream. And to top things off, at the bar we ran into some ball players there for spring training. My customer and I got a pic with Rickey Henderson which capped off the night. They drove us back to our downtown Phoenix hotel in their Escalade.\n",

I took a lot of pictures, because the first time I've seen it 5 yrs ago, I never thought  its got a tag of a million dollar, but I am totally awed by this tall, inticate continuous flow of dark and white chocolate, that I'm so tempted to go underneath it, if it is not enclosed in a glass.\\n         Lucky they have crepe in front, fresh to order so I decided to try their \\\"crepe nutella\\\".

            "Review: The Trip \\n\\nRandomly decided last minute to celebrate my birthday weekend and of course Labor Day (in addition to SLS's Grand Opening) in Vegas, we figured that we would give SLS a try. After all, SLS in West LA is amazing! However, we have a slightly different feel about this hotel after this visit. We'll break this down to help you understand some good things and the bad (unfortunately, they have more issues than positives). \\n\\nThe Good\\n\\n- Rate was cheap for the grand opening during Labor Day vs where we normally stay (e.g Aria, Wynn) \\n- Traffic getting around in that area is light since it's roughly a mile away from Wynn \\n- Some of the staff were really nice and greeted you with a smile\\n- Comfortable bed \\n\\nThe Bad \\n\\n- Called guest services and was on hold for over 5 minutes. They have this repeated message that states how someone will be with me shortly. I just hung up\\n- Valet is a sad excuse of valet parking. I don't blame the workers as they were running and some where standing there. This is an operations issue and constraint. We had to wait several minutes but we tipped anyways even though tips should be service-based. Better service = greater tips. One or two guys running to get each car while some wait around doesn't seem very efficient when you have several people waiting for cars\\n- Lack of taxis - If you need to go to another hotel, expect to wait for taxis. They don't come here often and it's a waiting game. \\n- Room charge - be sure to check it fully for each person. We found that we were charged over a hundred dollars for some room charge. If we didn't question it, it would have stuck so be sure to check upon check out\\n- Working out - small gym as expected. Imagine a very nice city hotel gym and that's what you get. Not like Venetian, Wynn, or Aria's gyms. When I got there, there were no towels. I asked for some and one person told the other person, who then told me that they are out right now. No \\\"we're sorry let us get one for you now,\\\" just \\\"we're out right now.\\\" \\n- Hotel elevators in the hotel is much slower than I'm used to. Maybe for this particular hotel, it's okay. But the end-user experience for me was that I waited too long and is not what I'm used to when going to other hotels in the area\\n- Parking garage elevators are another story. We were valeting it but as mentioned, it was taking too long and had to get to our dinner reservations so we mitigated our risk by parking ourselves. It was full so we had to go to the very top on the 6th floor. Guess what happened next? ELEVATOR WAS BROKEN! So we walked in the nice 100 degree heat and then went up to our room to change/freshen up for dinner. Hoping that the elevator would have been fixed, we go back but naturally, it's still down. They should have at least let us know as guests and did something for us for our troubles \\n- If someone smokes in the room hallways, you'll smell it. Ventilation is not the best and random statement, when we checked out at 11am, there were 2 condoms in the hallway. Good times. \\n- Design was a bit gloomy. Walking around in the casino floor, we did a full circle in a couple of minutes. It's small and wasn't the wow factor we were looking for. \\n- Attracting the medium-income families, this hotel should not charge Wynn rates. Instead, it should charge Tropicana or NYNY rates. When we walked to the gym, we saw the VIP area and it didn't look like one. \\n- Not a lot of shopping so you don't get that overall resort feeling like you do with some of the major players \\n\\nThe Conclusion\\n\\nOverall, it's disappointing that SLS cut corners with this release. From the blanket responses on Yelp! (from SLS management), angered customers, and to the issues mentioned above, we'll likely never stay here again. They are ruining their brand image right now and it's sad to see. If you are used to staying at a quality run resort, you should stay away from here. Again, this hotel would be great the way it is if it was in LA or some other city. Not in Vegas.\n",

            "Review: Great alternative healthcare/medicine service in the Queen City! $20-$40 gets you a treatment! The acupuncturist was really nice and gentle, offering a warm welcome as I entered the office.\\n\\nBring your ipod and headphones. Although they do a very nice job of keeping it quiet, you still hear the occasional shifting of clients, sweeping of floor, or whispering. They keep it at 74 degrees and it is comfortable, but if you get chilled easily (if your Qi isn't balanced yet), then bring something light to put over you. \\n\\nIt was a lot more organized, clean, and cozy than I had anticipated. The bathrooms are located down the hall, outside of the suite and are very clean and modern. The ambiance is very soothing and inviting! I thought it would be a bit strange reclining in a large room with strangers while needles are sticking out of my body, but interestingly enough it wasn't weird at all.\\n\\nBring cash, you can also ask for a receipt to use your flex spending account. Register online, do the paperwork at home and save $15. \\n\\nI'm happy that they opened! I really like how they offer affordable alternative healthcare for everyone on every budget. Give it a try if you haven't done acupuncture yet! You may need to commit to 5 treatments or so to see a difference (at least that is what I'm going to do). If you have questions, they offer a Thursday session for you to get your questions answered since you really cannot get into details of your treatment at the time of service (do to the community setting). At the end of the treatment, I found that I like the community setting because it's another experience for you and a friend/spouse/partner to share!\n",

            "Review: This is probably the worst Oreganos location for parking.  Back in the 1990's they just had the one small building with a handful of spots, and everyone else was forced onto find a spot outside on one of the busiest streets in Scottsdale (Scottsdale Rd.).  The place always had long lines and a long waitlist, and even a decade ago they knew it was a problem.\\n\\nTo remedy the problem, they added on a small shack sized structure that is adjacent to the original building.  Great!  It's as if they didn't get the memo, and decided to add on something provided little relief to the problem they already have.\\n\\nThe atmosphere with painted wall murals is probably one of the better locations in Arizona, because the limited parking area is painted as well.  Wait times are on par with the other locations.\\n\\nDecorative menu is the same (Oreganos is an Arizona chain restaurant).  Food quality is the same as the other locations, and bears little resemblance to authentic Chicago pizza and Italian fare.  Service is inconsistent, and usually poor.\\n\\nThis place is a snowbird trap, so you're better off to avoid it in the winter months.\n",

            "Review: Wow! During a bi-annual allergy induced laryngitis, I went in search for my favorite tea- dry desert lime. Apparently, I am the only one in PHX who knows it because no one is carrying it this year. Next best thing? Find dried limes. This quest led me to Biaz Market. The neighborhood it is in is rough, but it's more poverty than unsafe. The parking lot, though, was full. Walking in I decided to spend some time wandering the aisles. Within 30 seconds I was blown away. They have rose water and orange blossom water for 99 cents! The only place I had found it before sells it for $4! Fresh produce, cheeses, meats. Fresh herbs that I can't find elsewhere for only 89 cents! What? Am I dreaming? An entire aisle of spices- so many that I missed my limes I originally came here for. The very, very nice employee didn't just tell me what aisle, she walked me straight to it and when I commented about a ground version, she helped me search for that. Dolmas in cans and jars for under $3 (and they're freaking delicious!). Pita bread 50 cents. So much yummy stuff priced so well. We don't often get such gems of ethnicity in Phoenix, but this hidden treasure made me feel sooooooo good on a sick day. I can't wait to go back and try the restaurant, buy more groceries and test my cooking skills, and get get my fix of the world abroad without having to buts out the bones for an international flight.\n",

            "Review: I'd go to fox only because they were pretty dirt cheap. $25/day for our one day rental during spring break. A taxi would cost upwards of $50 so I can't complain too much. The cars, however, were disgusting. I had an experience with fox in LA. all they had were shitty PT cruisers.. so my expectations for the LV airport weren't too high. THe first day, we got a chevy economy car that was actually decent. On out last day, we had several cars to chose from. The first one my husband jumped in didn't start. He jumped in a couple others.. they were all disgustingly dirty. He settled on a kia. It had stains on the passenger seat and back seat. The odor of coffee was stroooong... It could've been worse, I guess. So although I can't rave about this place, I'd use them again since we only needed the car for a couple of hrs to get to my parent's house/car. If we were going to be using the car for a few days, that'd be a different story. Oh, you know that free shuttle that takes you from the Mccarren airport to the car rental center? You need to wait for another shuttle to take you to fox since fox isn't in the car rental center with budget/enterprise/etc.\n",

There were about 12 people at our table so, it was hard to know who ordered what. We all asked each other \\\"who ordered the second pitcher?\\\" The answer was no one ordered the second pitcher, the server just served us a second one without asking, and added it to our tab. We felt that we couldn't dispute the check since we started to drink out of the second pitcher, even though we barely touched it as we all had to drive ourselves home that night.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, one of the woman in our group had ordered a glass of Chardonnay not knowing that there were several options on the menu. Instead of asking her which one she would like, they instead served her the most expensive one at $14 for one glass. If you have several different kinds of Chardonnay, why wouldn't they ask the patron which one they wanted?

            "Review: I recently wanted to treat a friend to a Lombardinos dining  experience. It was about 7:15 this past Friday night so I thought I'd call to see if there were any reservations available. I started from downtown and attempted three different times- no one ever answered the phone and I was sent to voicemail to leave info for a reservation callback. I decided to take a chance that there'd be a table or at least a spot at the bar for two. We arrive to find a busy dining room, not full by any means and an almost empty bar. We were told there were\\\"like 50 more people coming in\\\" for the empty tables but we could sit in the bar. We took seats at the bar and I tried to order two peroni's. We were told the keg blew earlier and apparently they hadn't changed it yet as I can't imagine you wouldn't have an extra keg of Italian beer going in to the weekend. We settled on specialty cocktails and got our first sips in when the hostesses told us there was a table in the dining room we could have. We happily moved and took a look at the menu. While tempted by a number of items I decided on the classic eggplant Napoleon and inquired if I could substitute the long spaghetti for penne or another short pasta. I was told by the waiter that I could have fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini as you didn't offer any short pastas except Orchietti-I thought I was in an Italian restaurant...strike one-no Peroni, strike two-no short pasta...really? I settled on the eggplant with a side of bucatini and my dining partner ordered the bucatini pasta as we waited for dinner to arrive. The plates arrived, steaming hot and piled high swimming in a dark, over cooked tomato sauce-I cut into the \\\"Napoleon\\\" of eggplant only to find that the former thin slices of eggplant, layered with sauce and cheeses had been replaced with an unpeeled slab of aubergine-approximately 2\\\" thick and raw in the middle, I cut around the edges and ate as much as possible and moved onto the second piece which was completely undercooked and bitter.  I ate the bucatini, studded with raisins and wondered if the waiter would ever return. When he did he snatched our plates up, never inquiring as to why all the eggplant was still in my bowl and asked if we'd saved room for dessert- strike three-raw eggplant and an adulterated Lombardinos classic-sadly I'll never spend $17 again for two slices of raw eggplant and a handful of pasta smothered in red sauce-net cost probably less than $4.\\nToo bad as you were one of the few almost traditional Italian restaurants in town-Francesca's has you beat and that's a sad state of affairs!\n",

            "Review: When I travel, I always try to eat as much native food as I can. Otherwise what's the point of travelling if you don't try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine. I was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native Indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest.\\n\\nWell, I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here, not just best native Indian dining experience.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located on the Wild Horse Resort complex, which is a native Indian resort offering casino & golf as well as hotel facilities. My only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotel/restaurant was poor, something which I mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with. Just in case it still hasn't, head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage!\\n\\nThere is valet parking available but self parking is no problem. The hotel itself is spacious and Kai is located on the ground floor. Kai is the Pima word for seed and there are many obvious native Indian influences, reflected in many aspects of  the design and architecture - this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they're very rightly proud of here.\\n\\nThe restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. The tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality - for example, the menus are printed on embossed paper.\\n\\nI think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is 'attention to detail'. I've been lucky to dine in 3 Michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world I've visited beats Kai for attention to detail. Everyone knew my name from my reservation. Cutlery restocked from different sides of the table. New napkins for every visit to the restroom. Crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish!!\\n\\nThe service is also friendly and very informative. There is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service. Foie gras is bruleed at the tableside. Soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers. Multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables.\\n\\nMy server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice. Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water!\\n\\nOnto the food.  I went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations. \\n\\nI was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local Indian flatbread - a local Indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it. This was served with a first rate fruity olive oil.\\n\\n1. Amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp, crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar. The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil.\\n\\n2. Avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche. The server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table. My first huge smile moment when I found my chilled spoon! This was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked!! The smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup wasn't too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavours.\\n\\n3. For a carnivore, I was amazed at the great salad which followed -  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the Gila Crossing School. The salad had a chilli dressing. It was accompanied by date cake with foie gras (yum!), Humboult Fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut.\\n\\n4. Baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust. The sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction, which activated all my salivary glands. An unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks. The giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree, fried salsify and fennel pollen.\\n\\n5. Seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that you can't go wrong with seared foie gras with me!\\n\\n6. Palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce.\\n\\n7. Grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. The meat was open and evenly textured, tender with a nice gamey flavour. The plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix.\\n\\n8. Lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce. Chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and I wonder if this is where it originated.\\n\\n9. Cheese. Belgian soft cheese and a Tasmanian cheddar.\\n\\n10. Medley of desserts. Corn creme brulee. Fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside. Italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit.\\n\\nAlso lovely to chat to chef de cuisine Jack Strong after the meal.\n",

This is very fresh, very authentic, very delicious Thai food. The restaurant is clearly in its very early opening stages. What is refreshing about the experience is that they are open and transparent about the fact and they will take the time to address the obvious kinks and give you the exact date for their resolution. Their (currently) limited menu is sure to point out that it's a temporary menu being offered only until their Grand Opening which is yet TBD. The ambiance was relaxing yet lively and vivacious. I was there for lunch and groups of people seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely and highly complimentary. I was immediately impressed by the menu; it seems as if someone identified all the best Thai dishes around the city and put them on one menu. I had the shrimp Pad Thai (which i believe should be the starting point and litmus test for any new Thai food experience), the shrimp were perfectly cooked, fresh and incredibly seasoned. The garnishing of incredibly fresh and crunchy bean sprouts along with the light dust of Thai seasoning added excellent texture and depth to the dish. The incredibly fresh green onion slivers added beautiful color and a sharpness that complimented the sweetness and spiciness of the dish perfectly. In all i found both the experience and the food to be fantastic; this notion was only exacerbated by the cordial and personal interaction of the manger (which btw is the tried and true key to long-term success on Murray Ave.) and the resourceful and friendly wait staff. \\n\\nFor those looking for a great new place to try and fantastic, authentic Thai food, Curry on Murray is a must try!\n",

            "Review: After a 6 month hiatus, I had family in town and we wanted Mexican food.  On Black Friday, we knew restaurants could be packed because of hungry shoppers taking a break from their door buster deals.  I reluctantly went back to Macayo's and I'm glad I did.  Whatever beef they were using before is back to the original and the menu items tasted just like I remembered it.  This time I ordered the shredded beef Macayo Chimi with rice and beans and oh was it good!  I barely finished my plate and I was relieved the quality of food had returned.\\n\\nOur server tonight was Ken and he rocked it.  He made sure our glasses were full and he served our food real quick and we had everything we wanted.  Even at the end he noticed my Father-In-Law's name on the credit card (he paid the bill) and said \\\"Thank You Mr. Rausin for dining with us tonight.\\\"  That was a nice added touch.  He really seemed like he cared about his customers.  We've never had bad service at this location.  My faith in Macayo's is restored and I will be back!\n",

They use to be the cheapest, but since renovations, I think pricing is more in line with the strip.  I'm not quite sure what was experienced by the individual that felt they weren't clean.\\n\\nI like the layout and attention to areas for relaxation. That makes it better than Mirage which doesn't quite have enough space for the chill out and Canyon Ranch which is more oriented toward being a Gym. The lighting is wonderful through out, low enough to make you feel at peace.  Also, the ability to grab water and hydrate or to put cucumber on your eyes in multiple places is fantastic.  \\n\\nIf you are like me and go to the spa to lounge around for multiple, hours, Nuture is a good one to put on the list. \\n\\nI still think that the strip doesn't quite pay enough attention to spa in general, so I can't give it the full 5.  I mean, go to Asia (half of the Casinos have properties there anyway), check it out and come back and implement all the details. \\n\\nThe only thing I would additionally mention, the spa is FAR from the parking area or entrance areas.  You've got a trek if you're not staying at the luxor.  Make sure to give yourself a lot of extra time for your appointment to get to the actual spa.\n",

            "Review: My family and I were flying from Austin, TX to Phoenix (final destination was Anchorage, AK) on June 28th. We had our 12 year old daughter, who suffers from a brain malformation schizencephaly, with us. She requires a wheelchair to get around in and we gate checked it in Austin. There were two tags placed on the chair. One was for the gate check itself, the other was the full itinerary. When we arrived in Phoenix, my husband saw the ground crew take our daughters wheelchair and place it in a vehicle. Well, when you gate check something, you get it when you get to the next city. Not so much with US Air!! Now, they decided that the wheelchair was going to go directly to our next gate. We had a 4 hour layover in PHX. 4 hours of carrying my 12 year old, 66 pound daughter around. Yeah, I don't think so. So when I asked our flight attendant she quickly jumped at 'we can't speak with the ground crew\\\" then proceeded to get herself ready to deplane. We took all of our stuff, including our other 2 daughters and my 12 year olds car seat, up to first class where we waited for the ground crew to bring my daughters wheelchair up. 10 minutes later, we were asked to deplane so they could get the plane ready for the next batch of passengers. We waited for about another 10-15 minutes in the terminal waiting for them to bring me her chair. When we finally got the chair, the lady was very rude saying \\\"Here's your chair\\\" then walking off. I will never fly US Air with my daughter again. This was completely unprofessional and unbelievably rude.\n",

My friend was like, \\\"Hey, why not....\\\" and into the parking lot she turned. \\n\\nLike other people have said it's not the most spectacular looking place from the street...plopped at the end of a shopping center. I wasn't expecting much....but it kind of turned out like a Susan Boyle.....that whole judging a book by it's cover thing. \\n\\nService was prompt and attentive. It's a small place and it didn't seem too busy. We sat on the patio and I have to say that parking lot is the QUIETEST parking lot of any shopping center I've ever been in. Very relaxing. \\n\\nLike I said, I wasn't expecting much and wasn't sure what to order. I was torn between a few things and ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo. As soon as I ordered it I was like, \\\"Ugh...why did I order that?\\\" It's just sometimes a restaurant will make a fettuccine alfredo that just leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Don't know if it's the cheese they use or what. So, like I said, I was dreading it. That whole Susan Boyle thing I alluded to earlier. \\n\\nStarted with some bread and a small salad with a creamy Italian dressing. Pretty good. \\n\\nThen out came my fettuccine alfredo. It looked good....and it smelled good. And I have to admit it was the BEST fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Creamy, rich, and oh so good. I was SO happy I ordered it. \\n\\nWe ended with a creme carmel for dessert which was just right to top off our dinner. \\n\\nAfter dinner went inside to use the restroom and the restaurant was even smaller inside than I thought. \\n\\nChatted a bit with one of the employees about the restaurant and the owners.

            "Review: I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is.\n",

I got 1 good haircut from the owner and the next two that she did were nowhere near as good.  I even had to fix an obviously too long piece that did not fit with the rest of my bangs. I switched to another girl who did a not great job the first time and I went back thinking she just needed to get to know my hair. HA! The second time she not only slaughtered the haircut but really did a terrible color. Number one lesson girls, don't cut a person's hair too short on top if it's fine, especially fine and curly.  I did complain especially about the color and she put a glosser on it that made the \\\"caramel\\\" (read brassy yellow) highlights look less like a peroxide bottle exploded in my direction, for a few shampoos, but eventually it faded back to that horrible color job and seriously dried out my hair. \\n I haven't been back to this place in a while but I still remember how ugly I felt for months and months after that last horrible cut and color.  I saw that I had never posted this review from a while back so I went ahead and posted it now.

If you want to charge me $40 for an entree, you better have the proper service that is expected at that price point.

Not a lot more but throw in a vegetable for cryin out loud.  \\n\\nMore importantly, the service was weak.  I asked for an explanation of some of the beverages - and was told they were powdered. Now that's how to get me to give you my money... Really?  They're powdered?  Yummm.     The grandmother, who clearly is passionate about her recipes, needs to whip those slack jawed, goth kids into shape, yell at them about their lack of a work ethic and fill them in on a few things -- first of which is pride in her food, how is it prepared, what is it...why should I care!  I want to know...I'm interested, don't look at me when I ask these questions like I've grown horns!  Then third...bus your damned tables!  If you don't clean the tables, you can't seat new guests...  Get busy!   Votive candles on the tables don't make money...they're just a fire hazard.  Or put them out in the afternoon when the sun is setting so they don't just look stupid. \\n\\nIf a single guest comes in to eat lunch - and you only have 4 tops, don't keep asking them if they're sure they don't want to take their lunch to go...You designed the damned restaurant with only 4 tops and no counter space, it's not my problem.

From the Indigo Girls to DSO, the Brazilian Girls, North Mississippi Allstars, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, to my most recent show-- the Blue Dogs and Drivin N Cryin, this is just a fantastic and friendly venue to see and hear a show.  \\n\\nIt gets loud and it can get crowded (very crowded) but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd.  On occasion you might want to get there early (bring a yard chair) if you want to grab a general admission seat (just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you, and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring) and reserve your seat... now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start!  Seriously, it is that friendly... but, remember your seats won't allow for you to view the show, which is great for say, a husband who got dragged to see the IG.  \\n\\nThere are seats upstairs that are sometimes open, sometimes included in the GA price and sometimes reserved, just check the show listing.  There is also a VIP seating area that comes with a server.  I am fine to get my own PBR or-- the value cup!-- a big ole, in the case of this past weekend, Sierra Nevada.  Score!\\n\\nBathrooms surprisingly rarely have much of a wait... probably because you want to get in and out as fast as you can...but, they do have a Dyson hand dryer (the long one that you take your hands in and out of while hearing a sound similar to a jet engine!).  \\n\\nThis spot is a neighborhood staple and is an anchor to the area.  It is truly local business at its finest.  It also really helped ramp up the music scene in Charlotte...\n",

            "Review: I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.  \\n\\nFor starters, the \\\"drive thru\\\" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your \\\"food,\\\" at which point you're beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit.\\n\\nIt's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe.\\n\\nOk... entrance/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience.\\n\\nToday's experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points).\\n\\nWhen I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a \\\"large #3 with Coke.\\\"  \\n\\nMcD's Microphone Dude: \\\"Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: \\\"Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke.\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: \\\"Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: (long pause) \\\"Do you want a large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Yes, and the #3.\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: (long pause) \\\"So, that's a #3 with large Coke?\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nMDMD: \\\"Ok.\\\"\\n\\nMe: (long pause) \\\"Can I continue with the order?\\\"  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct)\\n\\nMDMD: (long pause) \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nMe: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids...\\n\\nMDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready.\\n\\nMe: ...drives around...\\n\\nKid at window: \\\"That'll be $18.14.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal.\\\"\\n\\nKid at window: \\\"You can.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"So, why all of the confusion?\\\"\\n\\nKid: \\\"I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Oh, ok.\\\"\\n\\nSo, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever...\\n\\nI returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return.\\n\\n\\nPrevious visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window.\\n\\nThanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.  I think I'll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure.\n",

            "Review: This review is for a mid-afternoon visit on 2/27/13...\\n\\nDisappointing.  This pretty much sums up our experience.  It was our first time at Tailgaters and short of something monumental happening, it will be our last.\\n\\nThe decor is ok, it screams pizza joint turned sports bar.  This works out and will be great come summer when trying to find a cool, dark place to get out of the heat.  The restroom was clean and interestingly, the only place where I learned of the daily specials (they were posted on the wall by the sinks) after we ordered (the waitress never said a word about them and we didn't see them anywhere in the actual bar/restaurant area).\\n\\nIt's all a downhill review from here so if you are looking for reasons to go, stop reading now!\\n\\nWe entered the place to find two people standing at the front desk and a sign reading \\\"please seat yourself.\\\"  While the two holding the desk up appeared to acknowledge our presence, we were not greeted.  We selected a table away from the crowd in the bar because all the high tops appeared to be for larger groups and we were there to have a late lunch not get sh*t-faced on happy hour specials...\\n\\nThe first person to approach us might have been a manager and seemed concerned about how long we had been sitting without attention.  The main man asked about the on-tap selection as he thought a beer would taste good on the lovely spring day (remember we were primarily there for lunch not booze).  This guy didn't know the beer selection at all and went to the bar to bring us a list conjured up in some word processing program (not a formal menu).\\n\\nHe dumps this paper on us then disappears.  A few seconds later a different guy, clearly staff, appears and asks if we are ready to order.  We ask for menus and water and he disappears.  Within seconds we get a waitress who asks if she can get our drink order.  The main man orders a Kiltlifter and she zooms away from the table; I have to holler at her that I'd like whatever diet soda they have... This is the first time she seems to even notice I'm there.  My husband is a very handsome man but he isn't Brad Pitt!\\n\\nShe brings the drinks, in two separate trips, and we have to stop her from zipping off again to order.  She seems pretty put out by the fact that we want food off the menu and not just stuff from the Happy Hour app menu.\\n\\nWe get the HH quesadilla, the turkey bacon melt, and the bacon cheeseburger (ordering the cheeseburger should have been a moment where she could have offered the two-for-one burger special but she didn't).\\n\\nThe quesadilla arrives, it looks nice, the tortilla is perfectly grilled, but it's just plain cheese inside.  No seasoning, nothing special.  It is exactly as it reads in the menu and exactly what my 7 year old niece would make if I asked her for a cheese quesadilla.  \\n\\nOur waitress cruises the table and inquires about the quesadilla.  When the man says \\\"it's ok\\\" she responds by asking if he wants another beer (he's not even halfway through the original 16 oz).  When he says no, she zips away agin (I'm out of water and could use a soda refill but she apparently can't be bothered with such trivial matters).\\n\\nThe food arrives and our immediate reaction is WTF????  The turkey bacon melt is made with bacon bits and chopped turkey that falls right out of it the minute he picks it up.  It tastes ok but again, my niece could pull this off...  The burger is damn near slider sized and literally hiding in a bun twice the size of the meat patty.  It had two actual slices of bacon and tasted decent but again no seasoning and it was within my the abilities of my niece.  The fries weren't worth eating, pretty sure they came from a bag in the freezer.\\n\\nAs we are eating, the waitress speeds past and asks how things are and again, the man says \\\"it's ok\\\" and she responds with \\\"want another beer?\\\"  When he says no, she's gone again (still no refills of water or soda).\\n\\nWe finish and pile our dishes and the waitress comes and removes them only now asking if I'd like any refills.  When I respond no, she takes all but one plate and disappears.  And we wait.... And wait...\\n\\nHas anything about our visit indicated we want to spend one more minute in this place?  Our beverages are gone and we have declined more, the food that was edible is gone and we haven't ordered more, by my count, this is when the bill usually arrives.  Nope, we have to wave her down and ask for the bill and she seems genuinely surprised that we want out... She never smiled, she never greeted us, she never refilled beverages (only asking when the man clearly hadn't had enough alcohol for the food to be better than ok and after the meal was over), she never gave us a reason to stay.  \\n\\nNot one thing about our visit gives us a reason to go back.\\n\\nSave yourself the frustration of lackluster service by personnel that look more like biker-bar parolees than professional servers and marginal food.  Go elsewhere, anywhere, but not there.\n",

Unfortunately this Bdub's has the worst service I've every had in any resturaunt. We tried this location three times...Not on one, but TWO occasions in an almost empty resturaunt  I had to get up and get our order after we watched it sit in a window under the heat lamps for around 20 minutes without a single server in sight... On our last visit after waiting for a half hour for the server to bring our check just to dissapear into thin air again, after another 20 or so minutes we paid our bill with the bartender and left... After we were out the door our waitress suddenly appeared and yelled that we forgot to leave her tip at the bar... SERIOUSLY.. So as sad as we were we admitted defeat and our wing cravings will have to fufilled somewhere further from home.\n",

I see her whenever possible and even when I see her outside of the clinic she always remembers my fur babies and to stop and ask how they're doing. \\nUnfortunetly, when my little girl passed, I had to see someone different who was on call. Dr. Khamsi was nothing short of amazing. The procedure was going to cost $$$$ - and when I asked in her professional opinion if it would make a difference, she stated that she didnt think our girl would make it through the night and to not go through such a pricey procedure. She cried as she helped our little girl pass painlessly. \\nSome vets truly do care about your animals and not the money. I would recommend CRAH over and over again.\n",

That obviously didn't make me too happy but after trying Terryaki Madness I wasn't sad for long. I love that you can customize your bowl and they have a variety of different options including some Hawaiian dishes. It's always clean and smells good in the restaurant in the bathrooms believe it or not look great. That's a very important thing! What that tells me is that they do not only pay great attention to their food, but they also pay a lot of attention to the ancillary things that other restaurants let go. After the gym this is a protein in carb pack power lunch. Great for energy and increasing your metabolism! I highly recommend it especially for health goers. The only thing that I would try to find out is do they sell organic? Is there food non-GMO? That's important for me so I hope I get the answers I'm looking for.\\n\\nTerryaki Madness has a variety of locations across the city. And they were voted the best of Las Vegas. Check them out!

Booking went smoothly, they called to confirm the day of the event, and the driver was actually a little early to pick us up. The driver was very patient while we got our group together and sorted everything out. Our only plan was to drive around for 2 hours from downtown Las Vegas to The Strip, and our driver suggested that we stop at the welcome to Las Vegas sign for a photo opp. This was a great idea. He was also very accommodating when we had to make an emergency pee/booze stop.\\n\\nThe bus itself was nice and had all of the basics, but it definitely would not have sat 20 people very comfortably and was maybe lacking a little glam (can't a girl get some bubbling lights on her birthday?). Like I said, it had all of the basics, and the service made it worthwhile. Also, it was the best price I found online after a pretty extensive search.\n",

            "Review: In a word...this experience was underwhelming.\\n\\nI remember coming to Cabo back when they first opened, years ago, and just LOVING the food.\\nHave my tastes matured that much, that what once was awesome, and worth a 40 minute wait for a table just isn't anymore?  Sure, I think maybe they've matured a little, but I really think its just a drop in standards. \\n\\nThe whole night at Cabo was underwhelming, from the time we approached the hostess till we left, with the important exception of the service.  Our server was amazing, and the manager, after a bit of a misunderstanding in a complaint, was very receptive to criticism and feedback.\\n\\nWe arrived at the hostess station at about 6:35pm, and were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait...when there were plenty of open seats. We asked if we could just sit at a bar top, and she said that the servers were busy and had to catch up on their tables.\\n\\nOk, strike one, horribly understaffed.  \\n\\nThen we noticed the time, and noticed that their happy hour ends at 7pm every day.  \\nAre they trying to seat us late so we don't take advantage of happy hour?  Not that there was a lot on the HH menu that we wanted but still...\\n\\nLuckily, we were seated at about 6:50 (ten minutes to spare) and got our order of wings in for $5.\\n\\nOur server, like I said before, was a treasure.  She was pleasant, and kept my water glass full the whole night.\\n\\nIt took a while to get our chips and salsa, which we discovered was because the kid bringing the chips was also the ONLY busser we saw on the floor...which brings in to question:  How are their sanitary practices?  The same guy who is bussing dirty dishes is bringing out our chips and salsa...no gloves.  Hm.\\n\\nThe chips were good, but the salsas were a little...boring.  Another stations property has a Mexican restaurant with a salsa bar, and a MUCH better selection of salsa's.  Boring, and disappointing.  \\n\\nSo our wings arrived, and they were standard wings...nothing to write home about.\\n\\nWhen our entrees arrived, that was where the problems started occurring. \\n\\nMy chimi fajita:   This thing is ENORMOUS.  Like...ridiculously huge, fed me at dinner last night and lunch today, and I STILL didn't eat the whole thing.   It was served with refried beans and cheese, Mexican rice, and a \\\"garnish\\\" of pico de gallo.  The pico was laughable.  If you're serving me pico, I want enough to put ON my chimichanga, and there wasn't enough on the plate for the first bite.  \\n\\nAs far as the flavor goes...it started off mediocre, with mostly just vegetables on the end.  As I got closer to the middle, I found the chicken ,and that was actually pretty nice.  \\n\\nMy fella ordered the steak fajitas, and was REALLY disappointed.\\nFirst of all, he ordered them with NO sour cream...and received his bowl of pico with sour cream in it.  \\n\\nSecond, on the fajita platter, there was ONE lonely, tiny stalk of cilantro.  One.  It was mostly stem too, no leaves. \\n\\nWorse of all though...the steak was bland!  We could have dropped it on the floor and stepped on it, and it would have had more flavor. \\n\\nAt this point, we asked our server to speak to a manager.\\n\\nWhen we told her about the steak being bland, I think she may have misunderstood what we were trying to do, and she said \\\"What would you like me to do to the steak.\\\" \\n\\nUh...yeah.  We got a little angsty after that bit, and stepped up our game, letting her know that we were simply trying to provide feedback, that the quality of the food was bland.  For advertising that the steak is marinated, it didn't taste that way at all.\\n\\nAfter we explained ourselves a bit better, she was VERY apologetic, and offered to take the fajitas off the check (that wasn't  our goal, but since he didn't eat much of it, it was a nice offer that we accepted), and told us how much she valued our feedback.\\n\\nThe best part though, was that she came back out to the table after taking the food back, and said that she tried the steak, and that it WAS bland.  \\n\\nSo the good news is, if she is true to her word, and she seemed like she is the kind of person who cares about her business, she should get on the chefs to season their meat better.  \\nI was torn about giving Cabo 3 stars simply for her change of heart, but at the end of the day, the food just wasn't very good at all. \\n\\nI don't know that I'd come back here again, really...its on the other side of town, and there are better restaurants, but if I'm here and with someone who wants to come out, I probably won't say no.  I'd like to see if they actually make improvements.\n",

The staples on the daily menu are fantastic - their burgers are some of Madison's very best, and the specials, oh, the specials!  You have to go early because people are onto this place and they sell out fast.  It's worth the effort to get there, and it's worth the wait, even if it's crowded (it often is).  Bring cash or your ATM card.\\n\\nThe beer list rivals the food menu, with often-rotating beers including some that aren't seen often.  It's definitely one of the best tap lineups in town, and this is a beer town.  \\n\\nAlchemy is a very casual, unassuming tavern that doesn't necessarily tip you off to what awaits you when you order, and that's part of what makes it such a cool place.  \\n\\nThis is a somewhat short review but that shouldn't imply there's not a lot to say about Alchemy, because I could go on and on.

From the outside, the front of the store doesn't look like there would be a decent size shop on the inside. I stepped inside and i was immediately caught in the ambience.  I arrived at around 11 to noon so i wasn't expecting too many visitors. \\n\\nI was greeted with friendly and happy smiles, which I like and also mention in a lot of my other reviews of Vape shops.  I looked around at their products displayed so very neatly in their showcases and found some very good products. They carry a small handful of clones alongside legit mods and rba's. One that i should mention that i have NOT seen at any other vape shop are the Titanide Themis'. A sleek and very fancy looking mechanical mod made in France. Google and you'll see. From what I was told/remember is that the titanide Themis is made of titanium and jewelry grade Gold, which i find very unique. This isn't a mod review so i'll leave it at that aha. Though i find this mod a unique touch to their mod selection.\\n\\nOther devices i saw in the shop were the provari, z-atty, Nimbus, Prometheus, k600 and for clones i saw a kayfun 3.1 clone, nemesis clone, and the last i can remember is the nimbus clone. I know there are more in the cases though.\\n\\nAs for their juice, i only remember a few brands off the top of my head, Ultimate Vapor, Vape Craving, Five Pawns, and Hollywood(?). I've tried five pawns before so i skipped those and tried others. Some were good but most i tested weren't to my liking. Prices are/were typical to what i was expecting. The method of which you test are by request and served through an iclear16 if i can recall and for five pawns through protank 2(?), OR i think to drip. \\n\\nNow to talk about their shop and how it looks. I can't say how much I like how clean and neat everything is. The tasting bar's countertop is a nice and clean type of metal and also lit on the bottom with a nice bluish light, I can imagine the shop would look pretty cool at night. The showcases are I believe for show only, as they don't touch them and if someone wanted to see a device or accessory they pull them out from their \\\"customer display\\\" stock. I find this a good idea. \\n\\nEveryone working their are very friendly and i don't have any complaints whatsoever. If I didn't live so far from their shop they would see me more often. But for my first visit, I was very impressed with their store, their service and friendliness, and products. A must-go-to shop if you like meeting new people and checking out a new local shop!\n",

            "Review: This restaurant is one of those strip mall hole-in-the-wall types.  It's tucked away, unseeming, and with little character on the outside.   Frank chose this place on yelp and, to my dismay, we sat in the car justifying our choice for eating here.\\n\\nWe hesitated a bit while walking toward the door, unsure of what lay ahead, but we sucked it up and entered the front door holding our breath and expected the worst (dirty floors, bad service, poor food).  Thankfully, we were wrong.  This cute restaurant has the old school bamboo chairs and tables with menus ready to go.  There are a few servers ready to take your order and watching each table for refills or other needs.  We were seated promptly, received our drink order within a minute and took a good look at the menu.\\n\\nTheir lunch menu is simple--choose a meat, choose a sauce and it's 5.95. We wanted the regular menu, though, so we glanced at it and discovered some interesting dishes we never heard of; two, in fact: Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken and the beef.  They both had the same finish--a sweet chili sauce with garlic.  I decided to jump in and try something that sounded different to me, and we ordered off the regular menu at 8 dollars a pop.\\n\\nThe food didn't take long at all, and we were occupied with their lovely steamed (by request) vegetable dumplings that had the thai flavors mixed in.  The sweet soy dip was great, too, and judging by the appetizer we assumed that the lunch itself would be great.  We were right.  First off, the food was beautiful.  The chicken dish was shiny and glazed over with this transluscent, orange chili sauce.  It smelled fantastic.  Although flour coated fried stripped beef doesn't look as appealing, it didn't taste anything like the visual expectation of it.\\n\\nTheir sauce on these dishes are great; sweet, slightly spicy (you can order no heat) and had a garlic (subtle) finish.  The chicken and beef remain nice and crispy despite the sauce, which is something I always look for in fried dishes like that.  It was like eating crispy light pieces of chicken heaven drenched in sweet love.  The plates were piled high, too, so sure enough we had leftovers for lunch the next day.\\n\\nThey provide a bowl of rice enough for 3 - 4 helpings between 2 people, and because the sauce is slightly tangy and sweet (it's really like a thai version of a sweet & sour, but better) the rice is nice to cut that while eating.  By the time we finished the rice bowl was cleaned out and the leftovers neatly packed with more rice (they did it on their own, which was nice).  We patted our tummies and paid a 20 dollar bill (not including tip) that includes 2 dishes, an appetizer and drinks!  Their lunch menu, although cheaper, was good, but I'm so glad we tried their Bangkok 9 dishes instead.\\n\\nIf you're looking for cheap eats in a place where two worlds collide on a plate, try this hidden restaurant in Henderson near Hobby Lobby.  It's good, it's filling, and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet.  You know how I know it was good?  I dreamt about it and craved it the next day.  As a matter of fact I'm going to end this now so I can drive down there for dinner.  Ciao!\\n\\nPS: If any Guam people read this review, remember House of Chin Fee?  The chicken dish I refer to tastes like their sweet & sour chicken.  I grew up on it, so I'm a fan :)\n",

Friends from work were planning a birthday happy hour and called two weeks ago to find out information on providing a location for the event. Approximately 20 people would be coming and the person making the call asked if that would be an issue and if reservations needed to be made. She was told no, it would be fine. The restaurant is very spacious, so it could easily handle a group that size. \\n\\nMy friend and I arrived first yesterday to secure the tables. The hostess said she didn't think she could accommodate us because they did have several parties that made reservations. She hesitated, but eventually said she could probably put about 15 in one area, which we accepted. It took a while, but the staff assembled three or four tables to provide the area we needed. We went ahead and sat down and my friend asked the waiter when happy hour began and what specials they had. The waiter stated the happy hour was only in the bar area or patio, and not at the tables. He left and then a manager came out and repeated the same thing. My friend asked what if people walked to the bar, ordered and paid for the drink and returned to the table. The manager said no, you can't do that. We explained there would be people at the table eating in the restaurant portion, but there might be people order drinks from the bar and come back. The manager said if that were to happen, he couldn't hold the tables for us. While the explanation was occurring the waiter was kind enough to bring out some water for us, and a third member of our party showed up to order a diet coke and was planning on getting the quesadilla, but waited. Soon it became clear this place would not work out too well for the party.\\n\\nLooking over the menu, the prices seemed too high for a bar with a bull in inside. $10 burgers, egg rolls for $9, $8 quesadillas, $10 salads and $9 specialty drinks.  Happy hour prices the specialty drinks come down to $5, imports and well drinks for $3 and domestics for $2 - but again, only in the bar and only in the first-come-first-serve patio area.  If you have a large group, you most likely won't be to be in one of those areas or see those prices.\\n\\nI do know some restaurants keep the happy hour prices contained to certain areas, but it typically depends on the restaurant structure. A place, for example Applebees, is mostly restaurant and happens to have a bar, so it would make sense to keep the prices separate. Cadillac Ranch is more bar than restaurant. I don't know too many places trying to promote a nice restaurant image that would have a mechanical bull in main area.  Apparently the management is not interested in the revenue that 15-20 people eating and drinking all night would generate.\\n\\nAfter the manager's conversation, the waiter was a little slow in returning. I walked down to San Felipe but they could not accommodate our party at the last minute. In the end, we found a suitable location that provided the service, the happy hour pricing and atmosphere we wanted.\\n\\nThanks, Cadillac Ranch, but no thanks.\n",

The place is cute and you can dine in the restaurant portion or enjoy the bar or outdoor patio.\\n\\nThe service was very friendly and helpful.  I like that I can get unlimited amounts of water myself when it is hot.\\n\\nTried a bowl of the yellow lentil coconut curry soup.  It was huge and delicious and came with two slices of bread for only $6.  My daughter got a lemon bar out of the display case that was amazing for $2.50.\\n\\nI can't wait to come back and try other things.  The prime rib looked amazing but I was feeling to frugal to pay the $19 price tag.\n",

There's nothing really wrong with the service, it's friendly enough and they serve the food pretty quickly.  The problem is the food.  The kebabs in most takeaways look quite greasy and fatty, but these are in a whole other coronary leage altogether.  The donner meat which I tasted was salty and fatty, the salad wasn't too fresh and the chips weren't great either.  It was quite cheap, costing only about \\u00a33, but even this was steep considering the poor quality.  \\nMaybe I came at a bad time for them, but when there are so many decent takeaways in the area it's unlikely that I'll be back.\n",

We made a reservation for 10PM, and specifically told them that we needed to be out of there by 11:30PM because we needed to be at the Bellagio by 12AM.\\n\\nWe all got there about 5 minutes late. They made us wait another 25 minutes. We didn't all sit down and get fully situated until 10:30PM. We were told over the phone that they would section off a corner of the restaurant for us, and we would have 1 long table. we ended up being at 2 long tables, at different parts of the restaurant. They totally split our party in half! The food is ridiculously overpriced. The cheapest entrees on the menu was $28, which was chicken and salmon. Almost everyone ordered either the salmon or chicken. Everyone that had the salmon said it was way overcooked. Everyone that had the chicken said it was way to salty and kept drinking water.\\n\\nWe were also celebrating 2 birthdays and specifically told them. They brought out desserts for the 2 birthdays, but it took them forever. We tried to have them rush the check. We got our check and it seemed like we were going to make it to the Bellagio in time, but we waited about 30 minutes trying to flag someone down and pay them as well as have them charge a couple of credit cards.\\n\\nService was ok, nothing spectacular. They also automatically tack on an extra 25% tip for parties of 8 or more rather than the standard 15% or 18%.\n",

            "Review: The steak was perfect. Everything else was terrible. I'm going to try to explain why I am only giving this place a 2 star review. \\n\\n1st - we made reservations for 7:30 for 5 people on a Sunday night. We arrived at 7:29 and were told it would just be a few minutes... 40 minutes later we got seated at a table that was meant for 4. What is the point of a reservation if there is no table reserved for you??\\n\\n2nd - the waitress was opening a bottle of wine and accidentally cut her finger. Instead of excusing herself to deal with the problem, she pulled a bandaid out of her wallet and applied it at the table. I don't think that's very sanitary. It's also gross. \\n\\n3rd - the food came out 2 hours after we ordered. They forgot 2 sides. They also served our steaks with what I'm 95% sure was microwaved vegetables. If I'm paying $40 dollars for a steak, I'm expecting some fresh vegetables to go along with it. \\n\\nThe only respite was that they forgot to charge us for our bar tab from before they sat us. This is the only reason I am not giving them 1 star. \\n\\nThey do 1 thing right. The 1 thing that they need to do right. The steak. Everything else: the waiters, the management, the other food... Just horrendous.\n",

            "Review: I just realized I tend to give a lot of 5-star ratings to places. This isn't because I'm an easy eater/drinker. I simply believe there are some world-class places in Pittsburgh that deserve recognition and high praise. I've eaten and drunk my way around many of the world's fine cities and culinary capitals, and what I'm seeing going on in Pittsburgh's food/drink scene is something special. \\n\\nBar Marco in many ways epitomizes the great things that are happening in Pittsburgh. First, it is in the Strip. The Strip is a national treasure of a neighborhood and needs more places to go at night where you won't get shot (okay, only half kidding about that). There are some good things going on, and Bar Marco is a major addition to the night scene in the Strip. Second, it does incredible drinks. These guys know how to mix a cocktail and how to dream up some impressive combinations. This is the best place for cocktails in the city right now, and is up there with some of the hip mixology establishments in NYC. Third, the kitchen puts out some tasty dishes. Most are tapas style, which is perfect. Everything is delicious. Fourth, the space is very cool and nicely decorated. I want to buy the art off the walls! And finally, the guys who own and run Bar Marco really care about what they are doing. They are super friendly and clearly love what they are doing.\\n\\nThis is going to be a hot spot. That's great -- but I hope they make sure there's always room for their \\\"early adopters\\\" who have supported it on cold, snowy, wet nights in the early days. I'm glad this place is just two blocks from where I live! That means I can have a few Manhattans (which are incredible) and stumble on home. This is exactly what the Strip needs in terms of a neighborhood bar (that isn't beer-driven).\n",

The performers consistently put out 150 percent to entertain the audience and pay homage to the outstanding legacy of Motown music.  Growing up listening to classic songs from the 50's, 60's & 70's, I have very high standards for entertainment, and living in Las Vegas for the past 20 years plus, we have seen many incredible entertainers. Whenever we have friends in town, Human Nature is one of the top shows that we recommend. Each time that we have attended the show with local or out of town guests, they have thoroughly enjoyed the performance.  I hope that this show continues for many years in the future.\n",

However, it is very incosistent.  The past 3 times I have gone for lunch they have been out of something for the chicken cesear salad, but have not told me until I receive my order.  The first time they were out of parmesean cheese, the second time they were out of the usual sliced white meat chicken and replaced it with what appeared to be shredded leg meat and finally today they only had half a small to go cup of dressing.  All three of these items seem to be very important to making a salad that only has 4 ingredients.  If I would have known this upfront I would not order the cesear salad.  I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition, it seems a little pricey for what they offer.  I can pay $9 and get a better salad at many other places uptown, I guess they are able to charge for convienence.\n",

Second, I went to return Christmas lights and after debating amongst themselves whether they accepted returns they tell me it will be a 25% restocking fee. Nowhere on their receipt does it say that. I dispute this unclear policy which they did not like being questioned. Next, the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box.  Okay I will box them. But wait she says the lights must be tested. Great test them. Nope need to be boxed. Needless to say at this point I am extremely frustrated and getting mad. Finally, their \\\"manager\\\" comes out and he says he has heard enough of me talking to his \\\"girls\\\". What is he their pimp? Btw, he looks like a pimp with his fake tan in the middle of December and bleached hair. We go back and forth which at this point he starts yelling for his employees to call the police because he is kicking me out. His store is by \\\"invitation\\\" only and I am not welcome there. Fine I start walking out and we keep talking outside where he tells I cannot return the lights because I did not put them in the box and that he is not my \\\"maid\\\". He makes more threats about calling the police and taking my license plate number down. Awesome! I ask him for his name. He refuses and asks for my name. I tell him it. I ask again for his name and refuses again. I ask if he is the owner. Nope. Are you the manager? Yes. Awesome! I leave with the lights and will never shop here again. Horrible customer service!\n",

            "Review: The only good thing about this practice in Steele Creek is the doctors - Culp and Gilchrist.  I've had the privilege of seeing them both over the years and they're very professional, thorough and very good listeners.\\n\\nBut the reception/ nursing staff at this location leaves much to be desired.  Over the years it's become increasingly frustrating dealing with whomever answers the phone for appointments.  I have always gotten the impression of tired, confused and unsympathetic staff here and this past week was really the last straw.\\n\\nI tried getting a sick appointment here for five days now.  Last week I called and was put on hold - as is common practice there.  I waited five minutes and then hung up, as is common practice for me when I get put on hold.  (I can count on being on hold for at least two minutes when they have to ask me to wait, and that's at least half the time.  I can count on waiting, and I usually plan to wait, on hold and then have to hang up and call back later at least half the time I try to make any kind of appointment.)\\n\\nI called the next day - again put on hold.  Thought maybe I could make it through the weekend with my symptoms, so I didn't call back again.  Of course, the weekend arrived and I'm sick as a dog, but going to urgent care is expensive and there is no telling what the wait time is going to be, so I wait until Monday.  Called around 9am and was told they are booked up for the day but I should be sure to call back at 8am, when the office opens, the next day and I should be able to get in.  \\n\\nCalled back the next day at 8:30am --- I know, it's not 8am, but I wanted to get up and see how I felt before deciding I should see the doctor.  A different nurse tells me they're booked up and I should try to call back at 7:30am, which is when they start answering the phones.\\n\\nWhat?  They start answering the phones at 7:30am?  If I had known that, I could have planned to call earlier.  Previously I had been told to call no earlier than 8am?!  Now I'm sick, it's the holidays and I'm dealing with misinformation from an unprepared and disorganized reception/ nursing staff --- again.  This kind of thing is a common occurrence at this office, though, and I'm kicking myself because I should have known better than to completely trust what one person tells me there.\\n\\nAt least the second time around I got someone who reminded me I could try the new clinic at Target for a sick evaluation.  The day before, when I asked what my options were to see someone else immediately, the nurse told me I had no other options other than my primary care doctor.\\n\\nThese are trained professionals working in the health field?  I wish they could do better because I'm considering other primary care options in the future.\n",

The food has gone down hill, the bathroom was filthy with paper all over the floor and dirty floors. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was a joke.  The special was Bloody Mary's and I had to keep correcting him, by the time he was done...they were a site and he said he'd been working there over a year.  One patron had to ask multiple times for their check.  Another patron asked for a beer with no fruit, the bartender was insistent on adding fruit and the patron stated that she did not want fruit in her beer. He commented, it's a citrus blend, there's already fruit in it. \\n\\nThe bartender was constantly touching his face, and didn't wash his hands before squeezing lime into the Bloody Mary's, when he couldn't get the garnish of lime on the rim he tossed it in and said \\\"oh well.\\\"  When were limes in Bloody Mary's?\\n\\nThe bartender then disappeared for a bit, took others orders, fiddle farted around...I finally piped up and said we were ready to order.  After our food was brought out, he never checked on us. The fries were over cooked, and our drink glasses were empty.  We had to ask for water and refills.  He tried to take away my friends food before she was done, but left 3 empty drink glasses in front of my other friend. \\n\\nThe picked up trash off the floor, then started cutting limes without washing his hands.  After he cleared our dishes, he disappeared again, and we sat there waiting to pay.  He came back and started working on another task and I had to ask for the check.  He bright the check, we paid by credit card, he brought the paperwork back for us to sign and just stood there.  After we filled it out and signed it, he still just stood there, then he said that he was supposed to get the signed copy and I said I know, we are not ready to give it to you yet.  \\n\\nIn summary, food was not as good as it used to be, and the bartender who had been there for at least a year, needs to be trained in health and safety, customer service, and the items on the menu.\n",

            "Review: I stayed here at the Sahara with a friend who got the room comp'd and it was \\\"okay\\\". I wouldn't pay for it.\\n\\nThe check-in lines I noticed were extremely long. I requested a non-smoking room but clearly the room they gave us smelled like cigarettes (especially the bed). Perhaps they were giving us the shaft because it was a \\\"free\\\" room, but I really didn't like that.\\n\\nOn the second day while I was in the shower, the water suddenly turned off. My friend called the front desk while I stormed to the lobby to find out what the hell was going on. Apparently, there was a leak on our side of the hotel and all of the water was shut off. Okay, thanks for the heads up guys! The only highlight of that was we got moved to a much nicer room.\\n\\nI enjoy coming to Sahara for the gambling, it's one of the cheapest on the strip but the place is a bit far from the mega casinos so I'd probably stay somewhere else next time I'm in Vegas. Last time I was in Vegas, I got a really good rate at Tropicana which I would take again if I was on a budget simply because it's closer to all the action. I had a rental car anyway because I drove to Vegas, so the distance wasn't a big deal but if I didn't have a car it would have definitely been a pain. I'd probably pick Hooters or Tropicana if I wanted to go hotel cheap next time.\\n\\nI have to agree with other yelpers there is a total lack of $1 tables. I'd definitely would have played more at Sahara, but I didn't see any of these supposed $1 tables my entire weekend! Perhaps it is more of a weekday thing?\\n\\nI ate at the NASCAR bar, didn't care to try the buffet it looked crappy.

They do stand out in a few respects, and unfortunately food is not one of them.  At least not in a good way.\\n\\nThe first thing that I noticed is that their banner proclaims that this is the fifth location for this enterprise in the Charlotte area.  Yet strangely I have never noticed another, not even as I attempted to find one online while I was creating this review (note: I did eventually find one place up near El Taco Veloz with a similar name).  Perhaps a marketing tactic, or maybe they are just using another name for this new store.  Whatever the case, it is still odd that not a single other location turns up.  Anywhere.\\n\\nNext up is the staff.  Generally these small, dimly-lit quick-serve locations are staffed by individuals who do not speak particularly good English, yet are generally regarded as being at best one generation removed from (whatever country they have decided to represent via their food).  Not here.  This staff is instead a couple of teenage girls who are not only definitely American, they let you know at every turn they are interested in only your money, and the food is well down their list of priorities.\\n\\nFinally, instead of being served something that comes up rather quickly by a quick turn in one massive wok, you get to choose from a steam table.  Not quite a buffet, because you do not get to go back for seconds - and the food on the table does not appear to have been refreshed any time in the last few hours, or perhaps days.\n",

            "Review: We came here as an alternative to Pho Kim Long, which is always frequented when in Vegas.  The only things better about this place than PKL are that it's cheaper and they have really generous portions.  \\n\\nThe food was meh.  Their nem nuong rolls are huge, but that's cause they stuff it with lots of vermicelli noodle.  The nem nuong itself resembles and taste like sausage.... no pun intended. And theres like 2 pieces of it..  It wasn't terrible - just not very nem nuongish..\\n\\nThe rice plate that I had (bbq pork chop) was alright.  I thought it was a bit too salty.  And i asked for an egg over easy, but they fried the hell out of it.\\n\\nI didn't expect awesome service  - I never do when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. But on top of mediocre food, they have terrible service.  Therefore, the verdict of this review is 2 stars.\n",

            "Review: My daughter recently got married at the Mandarian Oriental and since she had seen their afternoon tea service was highly rated we decided to host afternoon tea for a number of the ladies attending the wedding (25 to be exact).  Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, she arranged for us to use the Bar room on the 23rd floor for our event which just happened to be where the wedding reception the next evenig was being held. It's almost as gorgeous during the day as it is at night.  The views are staggering. We opted for scones with Devon cream and jam and a variety of pastries with our tea (hot and cold). They were all a big hit and plenty was provided.  At the last minute (same day), I found out two guests only ate glueten-free foods and once again Angela came through.  I only have two issues: the two gluten-free guests were provided with their own plate of only 3 pastries each.  I think there should have been little more and if other guests chose to try one, all the better.  Secondly, I expected the tea to be served in tea pots but instead a variety of tea packets were provided and hot water and guests served themselves. Perhaps this was only because of our numbers but I expected a little more service for the price. All in all, the guests were thrilled with the event and all wished we had dressed up with gloves and hats.  It was a great getting to know you event especially since many were from cities mostly from all over North America but a couple from Europe.  I would recommend afternoon tea at the MO to any brides bringing  a number women together for the first time.  I think it helped make the wedding reception more pleasurable as we had already had an opportunity to meet.  Angela made it so easy to arrange.\n",

My sister, who lives in Vegas, swore that this is the best Thai food you can ever get, and with that, she booked a reservation for 4.\\n\\nThe place decor and the place itself is nothing special. Not the fanciest, but not the ugliest Thai place I've been to.\\n\\nThe food, however, is out of this world! I'm not too picky about Thai food, but I can tell Lotus of Siam knows their Thai flavors very very very well. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. My favorite dish was nam kao tod. I only ordered it because of the Yelp reviews, and I'm so glad I did!!!!! The flavors are so indescribable... I just wish the portion was bigger because the 4 of us was fighting over it, haha! The rice is crispy with a nice crunch to it and it has a sour lime taste, combined with small pieces of sausages or whatever the heck it was that made this dish so amazing.\\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of other things... tom yum hot pot, pad thai, soft shell crabs pad kee mao, some curry dish, fried rice, and I forgot the rest. Everything was on point and delicious! Don't be intimidated by the extensive menu... just experiment and pick something fun, I guarantee everything on the menu will satisfy!\n",

We sat with our feet in the water for a good 20 minutes before anyone was available to start with us. Not too big of a deal, but by then the water was cold and their massage chairs are NOT good. Very old... \\n\\nI don't like the gel/shellac polish they use. It chipped and didn't look good after about a week/week and a half (typically I can wear mine for 3-4 weeks without a chip).  My friend's color was completely see through. Our toes both turned out OK, but again they chipped completely off some of my toes by the end of week 2.

            "Review: The EXPERIENCE here, as far as service goes is absolutely top notch! Susanne helped my sister and I both find cars that were perfect for us without any of the haggle and hustle at the other dealerships. If you are going to purchase, I highly recommend seeing her. She's knowledgeable and clearly experienced in what she does with a no-nonsense approach, while still being very personable and easy to get along with. She's a breath of fresh air after all of the other dealers I had been working with! Dare I say she made my vehicle purchase fun? I do, I dare to say so. She. Is. Fantastic!\\n\\nThey have a decent selection here at Carmax, and you can download their app which is really easy to use to help you find cars that are out of state that can be transferred in, either for free, or for a fee, but it's all stated upfront on the website/app. They also offer extended warranties here for a very fair price, and if you take them into the Carmax service station, you get a discount on your co-pay. \\n\\nThe service station, however, seems to always be very busy, and it can be difficult to schedule an appointment. Even when you get through to schedule (or they call you back) the wait times to bring your car in can be long- so plan ahead if you can. I usually have to schedule about two weeks out when I call.\\n\\nThe time is took to actually purchase my car once I found it was ridiculously low. I mean, I was in and out of there in less than two hours I think, once we sat down to do the paperwork. It was very fast, very straight forward, absolutely painless.\\n\\nThe only downside (which is also a plus) is that at Carmax, you don't haggle. The sticker price is the actual price. So while their prices are *fair* you're never going to get a good deal here. You'll pay a fair price, but you also won't be ripped off ever.\n",

They kept charging me for cups that we never received or asked for; probably because the drivers make a bonus for up selling on site and people wouldn't notice a couple small charges.  They also raised our prices and hid the notification by replacing a general message that has been in the same spot since we started our service.  Haven't received the final invoice since canceling our service but I am sure I will be arguing and fighting that one as well.\n",

These rooms are quite spacious, and you can't beat a little late night jacuzzi overlooking the strip after a hard night of partying....\\n\\nThere were a few problems with the room - there was  cup of left over couscous in the fridge, and a coffee cup sat in the hallway for 2 days without being cleared away, but it certainly was not filthy as some of the other reviews imply.  \\n\\nThe casino itself actually feels more open, less oppressive and quieter than some of the other hotels nearby.  The bars are great - nothing flash or fancy but a great place to sit and grab a drink.  The tables are not expensive, and the staff are friendly.  They used to have camel racing, but sadly that was taken away - apparently there is not a a huge demand for spare miniature camel parts or something...\\n\\nMaybe the best part of staying at the Luxor is its close proximity to Mandalay Bay, New York New York, and MGM, which are, in my opinion, 3 of the best hotels on the strip to eat and drink at....\n",

The problem with this is you can't dive, you can't run or walk along the wave action pool, you can't stand by the wave to get hit in the face with a wave, which I actually wanted, you can't take a raft to the lazy river. FFS! Tubes only in the lazy river and good luck finding a chair after noon because you probably won't. The pools also close at 7pm so no sexy time in the jacuzzi late night. We opted out on the cabanas but found a couple of chairs our first and 3rd day but our 2nd day, we had to lay on the sand. If you only want a jacuzzi minus the kids, I suggest you walk to the south lagoon for the jacuzzi hot tub there. You can relax there if you don't have kids. Anyways, this place still gets a 4 star from me. Safety is important and they can't help the crowds. It's a very fun resort and another wonderful casino floor plan from this company.\n",

            "Review: This had the potential to be the best meal I have had this year and sadly it came way under par. I considered that perhaps I had built it up in my mind but everyone else at the table had the same feeling I did. So, with a heavy heart, I am going to say this meal did not deliver. \\n\\nWe arrived early and enjoyed a drink at the beautiful bar. There is not one bad thing I can say about the decor of this place. It is beautiful! Very modern and updated with incredible views of the city from the fifth floor of the Phoenician. The menu for glasses of wine is a short but satisfactory list. There is also an interested beer and cocktail menu. \\n\\nWhen our entire party arrived (8 people for a birthday celebration) we were promptly seated. That is when things started to go down hill. Our server was very nice and attentive but the food was very overpriced and underwhelming. Phoenix magazine has their Cesaer salad listed as the best in the city. I informed the group of this and sure enough, everyone ordered it! It is made table side (totally unnecessary) but it was NOT what we expected! No one like it - it was entirely too lemony - and i felt guilty for even having suggested it. However, the French Onion Soup was delicious. We were only served bread once our appetizers arrived which I found odd, but no big deal. Our main courses arrived along with our sides, except for one. We had to remind the server to bring it. The sides are very small and really only meant for two people. So, it was difficult to share them with the table which was disappointing. I had the petite filet which was cooked medium rare just as I had asked. Unfortunately, it was not as tasty as I had hoped. It was not bad, but certainly not the best steak I had ever had. Simply mediocre. The mushroom side was salty and the potatoes gratin was good. I didn't get to try any other sides as they were too small to share with a table of 8. My boyfriend has the braised rib which the server had raved about. The meat was falling off the bone (good) but it was the sauces that really made it unappealing (bad). Some one got the lamb chops and felt they were good, but fatty. Two people really enjoyed their rib eye. Nothing but positive things to say there. \\n\\nAfter our main course, I double checked with the server to make sure he knew it was a birthday. He did and said he would bring out something for him. So, to our surprise, the next time he came to the table, he brought the check and said, \\\"Have a good night.\\\" We were all very confused by this interaction. We wondered if the dessert was still coming or if he had somehow forgotten in the past five minutes. He said it was still coming (and it did with his name written in chocolate syrup which was a nice touch). At a fine dining restaurant, the bill should not be brought before we were done eating. It was very odd. We enjoyed the dessert (an apple tart thingy) and some sorbet before finally paying the bill and leaving. \\n\\nOverall, it was a mediocre experience. Our server was very nice and he cannot make up for the food not being excellent, but I think we were all put off by the bill and him saying good night before we were even done eating. But, enjoy the ambiance while you are there.\n",

            "Review: You could not pay me to come back here.\\n\\nI'll start off with the pros: Marquee is able to lasso some renown DJ's (I came the night Redfoo of LMFAO fame was deejaying) and I liked the music in the main room and in the smaller hip hop area. There's a nice balcony/pool area, that is all the more enjoyable if you go during a warm evening.\\n\\nEverything else about this club is a nightmare.  If you are absolutely insistent on checking this place out, I have only one recommendation for you: GET A TABLE.  If you do not get one, you will have to deal with the following:\\n\\n1) Rude ass bouncers both outside AND inside the club!  Yes, I understand you've been standing for hours herding and hustling people (most of whom are probably not fun to deal with, drunk or sober), but be professional.  You chose this job.  Or maybe you didn't.  In which case, it might be time to get that GED.  \\n\\n2) Crowds and crowds of people.  Maybe you're into that sort of thing, but I like to go to the club to dance, not have to deal with drunk white girls pushing me and screaming at me when I literally did not touch them and getting elbowed in the face and kneed in the back of my legs.  If you do not have a table, you will constantly be herded by the bouncers to places with no space.  You are NOT allowed to stand in walkways or enter dance areas that are already at full capacity.  If you stop to rest, a bouncer will yell at you.  If you stop to take off your heels to rest your feet (due to climbing an endless flight of stairs, see point #4), a bouncer will yell at you.  \\n\\n3) Nuclear levels of douchebaggery.  Some guy named Cash who is an employee of this fine establishment helped our entire party get in without a cover.  Honestly, I was thankful to him and wanted to just tip him for his generosity.  But we didn't, and he ended up spouting some nonsense to us about how he'll get us a table and free drinks.  Well, these \\\"free drinks\\\" ended up being $20 a pop and consisted of an 8 oz cup of club soda.  No alcohol.  My guess is Cash pocketed most of the cash and lived up to his name.  Uncool, dude.  No need for that type of play.  I would have rather he be upfront about things.  But that is exactly the type of BS that you'll have to deal with coming into a place like this. Naturally, Cash left to do his thang and the promise of free drinks and a table left with him.\\n\\n4) The stairs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=JvT5VYkd_3HHLnrljGKv7w.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Whoever designed this club needs to be fired.\\n\\nMaybe more alcohol would have helped me tolerate the Marquee experience but alas, I'll never find out.  I'd rather spend my precious time and money on XS or Tryst.\n",

            "Review: My wife and I frequent steakhouses and nicer restaurants at least twice a month, looking for 'THE' place.  You know, the one you love and can always count on for a perfect meal.  We are fans of Ruth's Chris near the Biltmore and adore Mastro's in North Scottsdale.  We came to Red's hoping to find 'THE' restaurant, or at least another top-notch establishment closer to home.  We live in Litchfield Park and have grown weary of hour-long drives to tasty restaurants.  \\n\\nI made the reservation online through OpenTable and when our party of four arrived the table was ready.  We went on a Saturday evening at 7:30pm and were very surprised when only a third of the tables were occupied.  About ten minutes passed before a harried and flustered woman who we could only assume would be our waitress arrived.  She did not introduce herself and pointedly asked if we wanted drinks.  She seemed abnormally rushed considering the emptiness of the restaurant.  Food was eventually ordered and it took an abnormally long time to arrive.  The portions were not very large, and at the end of the meal there were NO leftovers.  My wife's $46 dollar ribeye was very thin cut and not very flavorful.  My friend's Bison Filet was slightly better but very salty.  I ordered a $9 Caesar salad and it was literally six leaves of Romaine lettuce with a milliliter of Caesar dressing squirted onto it.  It was the least substantial and worst excuse for a salad I have ever seen.  The waitress even saw it when she was first delivering it--and saw that it only had four leaves of Romaine--and had it taken back to the kitchen.  When it returned, I was overwhelmed to see the leaf total skyrocket to six.  At different points in the night I saw the hostess stop hostessing and start delivering food and desserts.  Something tells me these folks are very understaffed.  \\n\\nWhen you pay this much for a meal you expect a certain level of service and Red's does not deliver it.  The total bill came to over $220 dollars (without tip) thanks in part to a 250% mark up on our wine.  I was embarrassed that we had brought our friends here and will not return.\n",

            "Review: Was excited to try Johnny Rockets Kennywood location.  Have been to other locations....do yourself a favor, stick with the other locations. \\n\\nWas told 30 minute wait due to kitchen backup, there were probably about 30% of the tables open.  Signed in and sat next to hostess stand where I watched 3 groups of people who came in after me, get seated before us.  Approached hostess to inquire as to why and she argued with me that she called me 3 times....I was sitting RIGHT there.  \\nGot seated and Brittany was our waitress....she was AWESOME and made us feel better about coming in.  I noticed many employees talking and standing around....one girl just wiping the same spot on an empty counter for 20 minutes.  The manager (Ana?) was more worried about her cell phone than the customers and never checked on anyone....so it's easy to see why the place runs in a disorganized fashion.  My burger was cold and I wasn't going to complain because I had already been there for an hour...just wanted to get out....I have friends who have had similar experiences.....so, eat a corn dog until Johnny Rockets Corporate office can retrain this inept staff....I'll spend my $46 elsewhere in the park\n",

I brought in a set of high-end dress shirts and when picking them up two had STAINS THAT WERE NOT THERE BEFORE!!!  It took the owner a week to call me back and he said they would attempt to fix the stains.  I picked them up the next day and there were two more stains on each shirt!!!!  I asked the owner how he suggest we fix this situation.  HE SAID, \\\"MY MACHINES DID NOT DO THIS!!\\\"  He argued with me and refused to do anything for two $70 dress shirts of mine.  DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THIS DRY CLEANER.\n",

The next three times, not so good.  The feeling that they give is that they could care less that you came in or if you come back.\n",

            "Review: In the world of TJ Maxx's this is a nice one. It's new and it's hidden. If you pull into the massive strip mall go straight to the back. The overall selection is good, and they carry higher end labels due to the location. The only reason I knocked it down from 5 stars to 4 was they were really lacking in their selection of home goods.\\n\\nThe checkout line moves quickly because they have this snazzy new technology that alerts you to the next available cashier. Overall the staff was friendly and I had a great shopping experience.\n",

            "Review: You know for a local eatery ok...but as a destination for \\\"good BBQ\\\"...it's not a destination I'd go for. Went w/ a part of 4..they have all these local write up's of their fantastic food, dating back to 2009... Well I think things have gone down hill..Had a brisket sandwich and side of vinager cole slaw..Sandwich was really basic.grilled bun & meat.  Meat as dry..had to slather it BBQ sauce on the table. Cole Slaw very sour....Service was okay nothing to warrent and over the top tip had to remind the server every time i needed a refill...Took a risk w/ the desert..blackberry cobbler as everyone was raving about it...big mistake served barely warm couldn't discern the taste of blackberries...but hey was late (7;30) probably scrapped from the last batch of the day..didn't even have a topping..not likely to return..I know it's a local place and should be supported..but next time I want BBQ it will be Famous Daves. Others had the meat salad..when all was said and done bill was over $65.00..pretty steep for 3 salads, 3 cobblers,brisket sandwich and an I tea..OH A/C was blasting was 65 degrees in the restaurant..had to go outside to warm up\n",

            "Review: I've been to The House a couple of times now and the food and drinks are good, however the hostess is just down right rude and needs to find a new job where she doesn't work around people. The smell of the gardens are great but the last time I was there, sitting outside was a mistake because of the garbage smell coming from the dumpster. It ruined the taste of the appetizers we had so we left and went somewhere else for dinner because we couldn't handle the smell anymore. A new hostess and a move of the dumpster is a must if this place wants to charge as much as they do for food and drinks.\n",

She left the stench of stinky underarm on the sleeve of my shirt when she sat down on me. I almost bought the deodorant out of the vending machine to give to her. Most all of the girls are very unfriendly and lazy. They have great drink specials but that is the only good thing about that club but I wouldn't recommend this club to my worst ememy.\n",

The wait staff truly aim to please!  We have had exemplary service from Judy, Sandra and Fabi...!  The chef always provides excellent, tasty meals!  Also, he will make French fries topped with green salsa and cheese! Must comment on the cleanliness of the entire restaurant and bar!  We think Baja Joe's does not have an equal in the east valley; so, we find ourselves dining there several times per week!\n",

            "Review: Besides the gym, the mall is probably my second favorite place to get my exercise on. Well, that is before I sabotage it with carby goodness. The food court is filled with pitfalls waiting to snag it's next victim. Auntie Anne's would not be so bad until you see them brush a generous application of butter on top. \\n\\nWith such a critical opinion of their practice, why would I give them such a high rating? Sometimes counting calories and nitpicking is a buzz kill. The cinnamon sugar pretzel is the answer to a sweet tooth. The pepperoni twist is like having all crust with pieces of meat. Some of the more popular items are made ahead of time, but I was told it would take six minutes for mine. Maybe the pizza inspired bread does not sit well and I am glad to have it come out fresh.\n",
